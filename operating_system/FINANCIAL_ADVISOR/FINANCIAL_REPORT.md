## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market Sentiment:** Risk appetite is cautiously returning after Tuesday's volatile session that saw the S&P 500 swing between -1% and +0.5% intraday. Pre-market futures signal optimism, but the "SaaSpocalypse" rotation—fears that AI will disrupt traditional software businesses—continues to weigh on tech sentiment. BofA's latest fund manager survey triggered a contrarian "sell signal" with bullishness at levels last seen in June 2021.

**Key Themes:** 
- **AI Crossroads:** Markets grappling with massive tech capex ($180B from Alphabet alone) versus uncertain ROI. Nvidia's Feb 25 earnings will be critical for sector direction.
- **Fed Path:** FOMC minutes today will clarify whether officials favor additional rate cuts in 2026. Citigroup economists see "a clear path" for further cuts as inflation cools and employment normalizes.
- **Consumer Caution:** General Mills' warning about "uneasy" consumers echoes broader concerns about spending sustainability despite low unemployment (4.3%).
- **Liquidity Vacuum:** Lunar New Year closures across Asia (especially China's gold market shutdown) creating thin trading conditions and exaggerated price moves.

**Watch For:** Housing data at 8:30 AM ET could set the tone; strong numbers would support "soft landing" narrative. FOMC minutes at 2 PM ET are the day's main event—any dovish hints could rally bonds and pressure the dollar. Durable Goods Orders will provide manufacturing sector health check.
