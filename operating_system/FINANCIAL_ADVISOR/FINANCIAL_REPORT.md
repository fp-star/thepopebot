## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Thursday Recap:** Major indices snapped three-day winning streak as geopolitical tensions and private credit concerns weighed on sentiment. Energy was the standout sector with oil prices surging on US-Iran tensions. VIX elevated at 20.23, reflecting heightened anxiety.

**Friday Setup:** Futures showing resilience ahead of critical economic data. Markets await Q4 GDP (forecast: 2.5% growth) and PCE inflation data—the Fed's preferred gauge. Hawkish Fed minutes have set a cautious tone, with some policymakers open to rate hikes if inflation proves persistent.

**Key Themes:**
- **Geopolitical Risk Premium:** Iran tensions driving oil higher and supporting gold. Strait of Hormuz concerns could cause supply shock if conflict escalates.
- **Inflation Watch:** PCE data crucial for rate path expectations. Any signs of "sticky" inflation could reduce rate cut expectations and potentially trigger discussion of hikes.
- **Sector Rotation:** Energy and industrials finding support while mega-cap tech faces valuation scrutiny. Market showing selective rotation away from expensive growth stocks.
- **Economic Resilience:** Strong jobless claims and manufacturing data suggest economy isn't "falling off a cliff" despite higher rates. S&P lowered recession probability to 20-25% from 30%.
- **Private Credit Concerns:** Blue Owl situation raising questions about leverage in alternative credit markets, creating headwinds for financials.

**What to Watch:** GDP and PCE readings at 8:30 AM ET are market-moving events. Strong growth + sticky inflation = hawkish for Fed = pressure on rate-sensitive assets. Oil prices and Iran developments remain key overnight risk. Nvidia earnings next week will be critical for tech sector direction.
