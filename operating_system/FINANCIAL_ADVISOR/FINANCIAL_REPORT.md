## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market Sentiment**: Cautiously bearish to open shortened holiday week. Pre-market futures signal continued pressure on tech-heavy indices as AI disruption narrative evolves from growth story to existential threat for certain sectors.

**Key Themes**:
- **AI Rotation Accelerating**: Investors shifting from "picks and shovels" infrastructure plays (Nvidia, Palantir) to established platforms (Apple, Meta) perceived as AI winners rather than disrupted losers
- **Software Sector Under Siege**: iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF down 21% YTD on fears AI will replace vertical-specific software; Autodesk, Salesforce under pressure
- **Rate Cut Expectations Building**: Softer CPI data and falling Treasury yields reinforce June rate cut bets; Fed minutes Wednesday critical for confirming timeline
- **Thinned Holiday Liquidity**: Presidents' Day closure and Asian Lunar New Year reducing trading volumes, potentially amplifying price swings
- **M&A Activity Surging**: Healthcare (Danaher/Masimo), Shipping (Hapag-Lloyd/ZIM), and Media (Warner Bros/Paramount negotiations) sectors seeing major deal flow

**What to Watch**:
- Palo Alto Networks earnings as cybersecurity proxy for AI security spending
- Fed minutes Wednesday for any shift in rate path guidance
- Software stock stabilization or continued selling
- Supreme Court potential ruling Friday on Trump tariffs
- Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data Friday

**Technical Picture**: S&P 500 struggling at 7,000 resistance for second straight week; slipped below 50-day moving average, raising short-term momentum concerns. Dow similarly stalled at 50,000. Both indices logged fourth losing week in last five weeks.
