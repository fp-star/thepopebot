## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market Sentiment:** Cautiously optimistic but conflicted. Wednesday's strong jobs report initially sparked a 300+ point Dow rally that faded by close as investors recalibrated Fed expectations. Pre-market futures show modest gains as markets digest earnings and await Friday's CPI report.

**Key Themes:**
- **Labor Market Stabilization:** January's 130,000 job gains (more than double expectations) ease recession fears but reduce likelihood of near-term rate cuts. Job growth concentrated in healthcare; concerns remain about sustainability and 2025's persistent downward revisions (average monthly gain just 15,000 after revisions).
- **Fed Path Uncertainty:** Market repriced March rate cut probability from 20% to ~5%. At least one cut still expected in June, but odds of holding steady have risen to 40%. Friday's CPI will be critical.
- **AI-Driven Bifurcation:** Sharp divergence between infrastructure beneficiaries (Vertiv, Micron, Caterpillar, GE Vernova, Eaton) rallying on data center buildout vs. software companies facing disruption fears (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Unity). iShares Software ETF (IGV) in bear market territory.
- **Global Outperformance:** Asian markets extend winning streak (5th consecutive day), with KOSPI and Nikkei hitting records. Semiconductor stocks leading on AI chip demand. European markets also at record highs on M&A activity and earnings.

**What to Watch:**
- Friday's CPI inflation data (most important near-term catalyst for Fed policy)
- Weekly jobless claims and existing home sales (today)
- Corporate earnings continue (earnings quality vs. AI disruption narrative)
- Treasury yield curve behavior (2s/10s spread widened on jobs data)
- Software sector stabilization or further deterioration

**Risk Factors:** Persistent inflation could force Fed to maintain higher rates longer. Software sector selloff could spread. December's flat retail sales signal consumer weakness despite strong jobs. Geopolitical tensions (US-China trade truce talks, Japan political transition).
