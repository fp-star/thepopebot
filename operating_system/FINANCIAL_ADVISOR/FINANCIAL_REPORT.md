## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market Sentiment:** Cautiously optimistic as markets digest benign inflation data that reinforces Fed rate cut expectations for mid-2026. The S&P 500 continues to test the psychologically significant 7,000 level after three months of consolidation near October's record high of 6,920.

**Key Themes:**
- **Inflation Cooling:** January CPI at 2.4% YoY (down from 2.7%) provides confidence for Fed policy easing despite remaining above 2% target
- **Rate Cut Expectations:** Markets pricing in multiple cuts in 2026 after softer inflation readings
- **AI Sector Volatility:** Technology stocks experiencing heightened volatility as investors assess AI disruption risks vs opportunities
- **Holiday-Thinned Trading:** Low volumes expected to persist through Presidents' Day with focus shifting to Wednesday's FOMC minutes

**Watch For:** FOMC meeting minutes (Wednesday) will be critical for gauging Fed's rate-cut timeline. Friday's Q4 GDP and PCE inflation data could reset market expectations. Thin trading volumes may amplify price movements.

**Technical Note:** S&P 500 consolidating just below 7,000 with 50-day moving average support. Failure to break higher after three months near this level could signal increased correction risk. Treasury yields stabilizing suggests bond market confidence in disinflation narrative.
