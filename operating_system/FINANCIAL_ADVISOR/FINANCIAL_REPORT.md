## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market Sentiment:** Risk-off environment dominated by AI disruption fears creating sector-wide rotation away from technology into defensive plays. The technology-heavy Nasdaq has lost ~2% YTD while equal-weighted S&P 500 outperforms market-cap-weighted index, highlighting concentrated weakness in mega-cap tech.

**Key Themes:**
- **AI Paradox:** The technology that drove markets to parabolic heights in 2024-2025 is now the primary headwind as investors reassess which industries face obsolescence vs. opportunity
- **Defensive Rotation:** Consumer staples hit fresh record highs as investors seek safety; utilities and healthcare also outperforming
- **Labor Market Resilience:** Despite strong January headline (+130K jobs), full-year 2025 revisions paint weaker picture with only 181K net jobs vs. initially reported 582K
- **Fed On Hold:** Markets pricing high probability of steady rates at next meeting; any June cut depends heavily on sustained inflation progress

**Today's Focus:** CPI data is critical inflection point. Tame inflation + decent jobs data could ease macro concerns and allow focus to return to fundamentals. However, if CPI runs hot, it removes Fed easing optionality and could extend tech selloff. Equal attention on whether AI disruption narrative continues to spread beyond software to other sectors.

**Technical Note:** S&P 500 remains near all-time high set last month despite recent weakness. Key support levels being tested. Volatility expected to remain elevated through CPI release.
