## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market Sentiment:** Cautiously optimistic as tech rebounds from recent AI valuation concerns. The Nvidia-Meta partnership provided much-needed validation for AI infrastructure spending, lifting semiconductor and tech-adjacent stocks.

**Key Themes:**
- **Fed Policy Uncertainty:** Minutes revealed stark divisions - some officials favor holding rates steady indefinitely, others want flexibility for cuts if inflation cooperates. This ambiguity keeps markets range-bound.
- **AI Productivity Debate:** Split views on whether AI will suppress inflation (via productivity gains) or fuel it (via economic acceleration and spending).
- **Economic Resilience:** December data surprised to the upside across manufacturing, housing, and capital goods - suggesting Q4 GDP may exceed 2.5% consensus. This strength argues against aggressive rate cuts.
- **Geopolitical Watch:** U.S.-Iran talks progressing but fragile; any breakdown could spike oil further. Market positioning remains defensive.

**What to Watch Today:**
1. Walmart earnings - bellwether for consumer health
2. Jobless claims - labor market stability crucial for Fed path
3. Fed speaker commentary - any hints on March meeting stance
4. Friday's PCE data setup - will drive short-term positioning

**Technical Levels:** S&P 500 holding above 6,850 support, but still 1.5% below all-time high near 6,982. Resistance at 6,900-6,920 range. Treasury yields stabilizing after recent climb; 10-year at 4.10% key psychological level.
