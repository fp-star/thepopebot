Energy, materials, staples and industrials are rallying, while financials, discretionary and tech has slid.\n\nThat level of extreme dispersion usually results in broad weakness, as the stronger parts of the market catch down to the weaker ones, according to BTIG. However, the new leaders have yet to correct, the firm observed. Krinsky said semiconductors is a key sector to watch to see which way the market will go.\n\n\"For most participants this is not a new revelation, but does continue to highlight how much dispersion there is below the surface,\" Jonathan Krinsky wrote on Monday. \"The million-dollar question is which way does the bifurcation resolve?\"\n\n_— Sarah Min_\n\n16 Hours Ago\n\n## Fund managers loading up on stocks, triggering 'sell' signal, BofA says\n\nInvestors are loading up on stocks at a high enough level to trigger a contrarian sell signal, according to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey.\n\nPortfolios are holding their biggest overweight position on stocks since December 2024 and their most underweight on bonds since September 2022, BofA investment strategist Michael Hartnett said. One caveat: Wall Street professionals are rotating out of U.S. offerings and into emerging markets and EU, though shying away from Japan.\n\nThe bullish move has triggered the BofA Bull & Bear Indicator, a measure of stock market sentiment that is now sending a \"sell\" signal with a reading of 8.2. On a global scale, Hartnett said bullishness was last this strong in June 2021. High levels of market optimism can mean stocks are overvalued and should be sold.\n\nHartnett recommends investors reduce risk in the first quarter and implement a number of pair trades that include going long bonds and short gold, long the U.S. dollar and short emerging markets and long tech stocks and short banks.\n\nIn other developments, Wall Street also has taken its most overweight commodities position since May 2022 and has edged up cash holdings to 3.4% of portfolios, just 0.2 percentage point off the record low. Investors are betting on a \"run it hot\" economy, with the most optimism on growth since February 2022, Hartnett said.\n\n_— Jeff Cox_\n\n17 Hours Ago\n\n## Gemini falls 14% following c-suite clear-out 108266494\n\nGemini Space Station fell about 14% after clearing out part of its c-suite. \n\nThe crypto exchange let go of its chief operating officer, chief financial officer and chief legal officer, according to its disclosure filed Tuesday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\nThe elimination of the roles comes less than two weeks after Gemini said it would lay off 25% of its workforce. \n\nThe company first went public last September.\n\n_— Liz Napolitano_\n\n17 Hours Ago\n\n## Dividend stocks are a good hedge against AI threats, says investor Jenny Harrington\n\nThomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nInvestor Jenny Harrington believes that buying hard asset, low obsolescence dividend stocks could be a good hedge against growing artificial intelligence threats.\n\n\"They're stocks that, assuming humanity survives AI, we're going to be using these products throughout in the next 10, 15, 20 years,\" the CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management said on CNBC's \"[Halftime Report](https://www.cnbc.com/halftime/)\" on Tuesday afternoon. \"Nothing too exciting, just slow and steady.\"\n\nTo that end, Harrington listed stocks such as [Amcor](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMCR/), [Kimberly-Clark](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KMB/), [Bristol-Myers Squibb](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BMY/) and [Dominion Energy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/D/) as ones that fit the bill.

Hollenhorst said that same sentiment is likely to be reflected in minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting that will be released Wednesday.\n\n\"Markets have appropriately recognized the residual seasonality in jobs data and cooling trend in inflation,\" he added. \"That means policy rates are likely to fall further this year. It also means pricing of Fed rate cuts is free to increase further as part of the general risk-off in markets.\"\n\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Tuesday that he expects additional rate cuts this year so long as the inflation data cooperates.\n\n_— Jeff Cox_\n\n17 Hours Ago\n\n## General Mills heads for worst day si\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Fed Minutes and AI Sentiment Drive Premarket Gains: S&P 500 Futures Rise Ahead of Key Economic Data - Market Updates\nLink: https://stockmarketwatch.com/live/stock-market-today/\nAge: 22 seconds ago\nSnippet: <strong>The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) currently sits near the 6,843 level</strong>, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP) is hovering around 22,578. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) remains resilient near the 49,553 mark. While the broader market has been mostly sidetracked by what analysts are calling the ...\nContent:\n## Premarket Activity and Futures\n\nU.S. stock futures are trending higher on Wednesday morning, February 18, 2026, as investors shake off recent volatility tied to artificial intelligence (AI) valuation concerns. As of the early morning hours, [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) futures have advanced 0.6%, while Nasdaq 100 ([NDX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NDX)) futures are leading the pack with a 0.7% gain. The [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) futures are also in positive territory, up 0.5%.\n\nThis upward movement suggests a \"dip-buying\" mentality is taking hold following a choppy session on Tuesday. Market participants are balancing \"AI jitters\"—fears that massive capital expenditures in the tech sector may not yield immediate returns—against a robust domestic economy and the potential for a strategic pivot in global trade.\n\n## Index Performance and Trends\n\nThe major market indexes are looking to build on the marginal gains achieved during Tuesday's session. The S&P 500 ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) currently sits near the 6,843 level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([COMP](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/COMP)) is hovering around 22,578. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DIA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DIA)) remains resilient near the 49,553 mark.\n\nWhile the broader market has been mostly sidetracked by what analysts are calling the \"SaaSpocalypse\"—a rotation out of software-as-a-service stocks due to AI disruption—defensive sectors like Utilities and Health Care have shown strength. However, the current [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trend indicates a return to growth-oriented sectors, provided today's economic data and central bank insights support a \"soft landing\" narrative.\n\n## Upcoming Economic Catalysts\n\nThe primary focus for today’s session is the 2:00 PM ET release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the January meeting. Traders are scouring the text for clues regarding the Federal Reserve's internal debate over interest rate cuts. Current market pricing reflects a high probability of a rate hold in March, but investors are eager to see if officials are leaning toward a June cut.\n\nBefore the opening bell, a flurry of economic data at 8:30 AM ET will set the tone. This includes January Building Permits (expected at 1.400M) and Housing Starts, which will provide a health check on the residential construction sector. Additionally, the Durable Goods Orders report for January is forecast to show a 1.7% decline, a figure that could influence manufacturing sentiment and broader GDP expectations for the first quarter of 2026.\n\n## Corporate News and Major Ticker Movements\n\nIn corporate news, Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) remains the market's central bellwether. Although its official earnings report is not due until February 25, the stock is seeing [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") interest as investors debate its $4.66 trillion valuation. Other \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, including Microsoft ([MSFT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MSFT)), Apple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)), and Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/GOOGL)), are also trending higher in early trading.\n\nA bidding war is heating up in the media sector. Paramount Global ([PARA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PARA)) shares jumped nearly 5% after Warner Bros. Discovery ([WBD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WBD)) signaled it would allow Paramount to submit a \"best and final\" bid to counter an existing offer from Netflix ([NFLX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NFLX)). Meanwhile, Amazon ([AMZN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMZN)) is looking to recover from recent pressure as it navigates the shifting AI landscape.\n\nOn the downside, General Mills ([GIS](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/GIS)) saw its stock tumble 7% in the previous session after warning of \"uneasy\" consumer sentiment, a trend that investors will watch closely across the consumer staples sector today.

Expert insights on the transition.\nContent:\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – March 2025: The United States economy is undergoing a significant transition as growth rates moderate toward their long-term potential, according to comprehensive analysis from TD Securities. This cooling represents a crucial shift from the post-pandemic recovery phase to more sustainable expansion patterns that carry profound implications for monetary policy, financial markets, and economic stability.\n\n## Understanding the US Economic Growth Transition\n\nTD Securities economists recently published detailed research indicating that US economic growth is cooling back to its estimated potential rate. This potential growth rate represents the maximum sustainable pace at which an economy can expand without generating excessive inflationary pressures. The analysis suggests the current transition marks a return to normalcy after years of volatile post-pandemic expansion.\n\nHistorically, the US potential growth rate has hovered between 1.8% and 2.2% annually. This figure reflects underlying productivity growth, labor force expansion, and capital accumulation. The Federal Reserve closely monitors this metric when making monetary policy decisions. Consequently, understanding this cooling process provides essential context for anticipating future interest rate movements and economic conditions.\n\n## Key Indicators of Economic Cooling\n\nSeveral economic indicators support TD Securities’ assessment of moderating growth. The labor market shows signs of normalization with job gains returning to sustainable levels. Wage growth has moderated while remaining positive. Manufacturing and services PMI readings indicate expansion at more measured paces. Consumer spending continues to grow but at rates consistent with income growth rather than pandemic-era stimulus effects.\n\nInflation metrics have shown consistent improvement, with core PCE inflation approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Housing market activity has stabilized after previous volatility. Business investment continues but with more selective capital allocation. These indicators collectively paint a picture of an economy transitioning from rapid recovery to steady expansion.\n\n### Comparative Economic Analysis Table\n\n| Economic Period | Average GDP Growth | Inflation Rate | Unemployment Rate |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Post-Pandemic Recovery (2021-2023) | 3.8% | 5.4% | 3.9% |\n| Transition Phase (2024) | 2.6% | 3.2% | 4.1% |\n| Potential Growth Phase (2025 Projection) | 2.0% | 2.1% | 4.2% |\n\n## Monetary Policy Implications\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces complex decisions as growth cools to potential levels. With inflation approaching target ranges, policymakers must balance multiple objectives. They seek to maintain price stability while supporting sustainable employment. The cooling growth environment provides the Federal Open Market Committee with increased policy flexibility.\n\nInterest rate decisions will likely reflect this new economic reality. The terminal rate for this cycle may stabilize at levels modestly above pre-pandemic norms. Balance sheet normalization may proceed at measured paces. Forward guidance will emphasize data dependence and risk management. These policy adjustments aim to extend the current economic expansion while preventing overheating.\n\n### Expert Perspectives on the Transition\n\nSenior TD Securities economists emphasize the importance of this transition for long-term economic health. “Sustainable growth at potential levels supports economic stability,” explains their lead US economist. “This cooling represents successful normalization rather than concerning weakness.” The analysis draws on decades of economic cycle research and real-time data analysis.\n\nOther financial institutions echo similar assessments while noting regional variations. The cooling appears most pronounced in previously overheated sectors while service industries maintain steady expansion. This sectoral rebalancing contributes to overall economic resilience. The transition reflects natural economic forces rather than policy-induced contraction.\n\n## Market Reactions and Investment Implications\n\nFinancial markets have responded to growth cooling with measured adjustments. Equity valuations reflect more sustainable earnings growth expectations. Bond markets price in stable monetary policy environments. Currency markets show balanced flows as growth differentials narrow between the US and other major economies.\n\nInvestors should consider several implications:\n\n* **Equity sectors:** Defensive sectors may outperform during transitions\n* **Fixed income:** Duration strategies may benefit from stable rates\n* **Real assets:** Inflation-sensitive assets require careful selection\n* **Geographic allocation:** International diversification gains importance\n\n## Historical Context and Future Projections\n\nEconomic history provides valuable perspective on growth transitions. Previous cycles show that sustainable expansions typically follow periods of moderation.

As the world’s largest physical buyers go offline, trading volumes thin out, often resulting in exaggerated price volatility and wider bid-ask spreads. Historically, this period triggers a price correction; once the pre-holiday buying pressure from China ceases, traders who entered positions early often engage in profit-taking, leading to a downward shift in momentum. Silver is particularly vulnerable during this timeframe compared to gold; because Chinese industrial production hits a standstill during the festivities, the dramatic drop in manufacturing demand makes silver prices much more susceptible to a sharp decline.

This site uses cookies.\nContent:\nThe U.S. economy continues to send mixed signals—showing unexpectedly strong growth, at least for now, even as the labor market slows dramatically. When people are employed and experiencing solid wage gains, consumer spending tends to hold up, including discretionary spending like dining out. However, the softening labor market represents the most significant downside risk ahead—not just for restaurants, but for the broader macroeconomic outlook.\n\nIndeed, the abrupt slowdown in job growth in recent months has been notable. The U.S. economy generated just 181,000 jobs on net in 2025, well below the 2.52 million in 2023 and 1.46 million in 2024. We predict growth of 750,000 nonfarm payroll workers in 2026. Yet, the unemployment rate remains historically low. Wage growth also remains solid, albeit with some moderation.\n\nIf job creation continues to remain soft, it could weigh on consumer confidence and spending, particularly in sectors sensitive to discretionary income. For now, however, the economy benefits from solid wage growth and low unemployment, even as risks mount.\n\nSpending continues to buoy the economy. Real GDP grew at a robust 4.4% annual rate in the third quarter, with fourth‑quarter growth expected to be around 3.5%. Looking ahead, the National Restaurant Association forecasts U.S. economic growth of 2.3% in 2025 and 2.8% in 2026. We anticipate meaningful tailwinds this year, including new tax incentives for consumers and businesses, as well as a modest easing in interest rates later in 2026. There is also hope for greater policy clarity, reducing some of the uncertainties seen in 2025 that held back activity.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve remains in a wait‑and‑see posture as it evaluates incoming data. Strong top‑line growth is increasingly balanced against signs of labor‑market softening, prompting the Federal Open Market Committee to cut interest rates at its last three meetings of 2025 amid concerns about slowing job creation and broader momentum. Further easing remains possible in the year ahead. Lower borrowing costs should help reduce the cost of capital for restaurant operators and support firmer consumer spending. \n  ![](https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/ul/4/2026/02/17/1_1771355382.webp)\n\n**Job growth slowed significantly in recent months**\n\nThe U.S. economy added 130,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in January, far surpassing the consensus estimate of 55,000. This marked the fourth gain in the past six months. Alongside the latest figures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued substantial benchmark revisions, reducing previously reported job totals by 553,000 for 2024 and 487,000 for 2025. Overall, the data continues to point to a cooling labor market, with payrolls increasing by 2.52 million in 2023, 1.46 million in 2024, and just 181,000 in 2025.\n\nOn a more encouraging note, total employment rose to 164.52 million, a new record. As such, even with recent weaknesses, the U.S. economy has demonstrated surprising resilience over the past few years, navigating multiple headwinds and an uncertain policy environment. However, the recent softening in labor market conditions could challenge the prevailing narrative of post‑pandemic strength. Steady employment and wage growth have been key drivers of consumer spending, and any sustained weakness could weigh on economic activity. \n  ![](https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/ul/4/2026/02/17/2_1771355382.webp)\n\n**Unemployment rate remains historically low**\n\nThe unemployment rate inched down to 4.3% in January, the lowest since August. The number of unemployed individuals decreased from 7.50 million in December to 7.36 million in January. At the same time, the labor force participation rate edged back up from 62.4% in December to 62.5% in January. Overall, labor force participation has essentially stalled over the past three years, averaging 62.6% since January 2023. \n  ![](https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/ul/4/2026/02/17/3_1771355382.webp)\n\n**Economy projected to add 750,000 jobs in 2026**\n\nJob growth slowed materially in 2025, adding only 181,000 nonfarm payroll workers, the weakest annual job growth since 2020. Yet, there will be enough tailwinds in the economy for the labor market to stabilize and pick up somewhat in 2026. The national economy is projected to add a net 750,000 jobs during 2026. Despite more sluggish job growth in 2025 and 2026, it should represent the sixth consecutive year of nonfarm payroll employment growth, adding the slowdown, 2025 is expected to represent the 5th consecutive year of job growth, adding roughly 16.7 million jobs since the end of 2020. \n![](https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/ul/4/2026/02/17/4_1771355382.webp)\n\n**Personal income growth expected to slow**\n\nWage growth is expected to continue in 2025, but decelerating employment gains will likely dampen the increase in aggregate income.

Unemployment rates reveal the proportion of the workforce currently without jobs and seeking employment, serving as a gauge of labor market tightness or slack. CPI measures the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, acting as an indicator of inflation levels.\nContent:\n![](https://blog.openforhomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/72f917c5b44c69c08a75cba6772f431d91e979da221701f2d008405ca94aeea4.png)\n\n## Understanding Economic Factors and Their Influence\n\nEconomic factors are vital components that shape the financial landscape and influence both individual and collective decision-making. They encompass elements such as inflation, employment rates, and gross domestic product (GDP). Understanding these factors enables businesses, policymakers, and individuals to make informed decisions, optimizing economic outcomes. Inflation, for instance, impacts purchasing power, affecting consumer behavior and cost of living. Likewise, employment rates signify economic health, influencing consumption patterns and investment levels. GDP, on the other hand, reflects a nation’s economic performance, guiding international investors and policymakers. An intricate understanding of these factors is crucial for anticipating market trends and creating policies that foster sustainable economic growth. Therefore, comprehending these dynamics is essential for effective financial planning and stability on both micro and macroeconomic levels.\n\n## Key Economic Indicators to Monitor\n\nMonitoring key economic indicators is essential for evaluating the health and direction of an economy. These indicators include GDP, unemployment rate, and consumer price index (CPI), among others. GDP is a crucial measure of economic activity, reflecting the total value of goods and services produced. A rising GDP suggests economic expansion, while a decline indicates contraction. Unemployment rates reveal the proportion of the workforce currently without jobs and seeking employment, serving as a gauge of labor market tightness or slack. CPI measures the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, acting as an indicator of inflation levels. Regularly analyzing these indicators helps investors, businesses, and policymakers to understand economic conditions better and aids in strategic decision-making, ensuring well-informed responses to evolving market dynamics.\n\n## Global vs. Local Economic Impacts\n\nThe intricate interplay between global and local economies significantly influences both domains. Global economic shifts can trigger local responses, as seen in trade agreements or international market fluctuations. For instance, changes in oil prices due to global supply and demand dynamics affect local economies through increased transportation and production costs. Furthermore, international economic policies can reshape local economic strategies, influencing foreign direct investments and export capacities. Conversely, local economic activities contribute to global economic health; technological advancements in a particular region can influence global supply chains and competitiveness. Moreover, regional financial crises may resonate globally, as was evident in the 2008 financial crisis’s worldwide impact. Understanding this relationship helps in strategic planning and policy-making to mitigate adverse effects and capitalize on beneficial opportunities both locally and globally.\n\n## Economic Policies and Their Long-term Effects\n\nEconomic policies play a pivotal role in shaping the long-term trajectory of national and global economies. Fiscal policies, such as taxation and government spending, influence economic growth and distribution of resources. For example, tax cuts may stimulate economic activity by increasing disposable income, yet could also lead to budget deficits if not managed prudently. Additionally, monetary policies governed by central banks, like interest rate adjustments, impact borrowing costs and investment flows. Policies that encourage innovation and infrastructure investment can enhance productivity, leading to sustained economic growth. Conversely, protectionist trade policies may provide short-term relief to local industries but could instigate trade wars, harming long-term economic stability. Thorough analysis and strategic development of such policies ensure balanced growth, economic resilience, and equitable resource distribution over time.\n\n## Predicting Future Economic Trends\n\nPredicting future economic trends requires a comprehensive understanding of current conditions, historical data, and emerging patterns. Analysts examine various indicators, such as GDP growth rates, consumer spending, technological advancements, and policy changes, to anticipate future developments. Digital transformation and technological innovations signify potential economic shifts, influencing productivity and market dynamics. Additionally, demographic changes, including aging populations, affect labor markets and demand for certain goods and services. Climate change concerns also shape economic forecasts, prompting shifts toward sustainable practices. Uncertainties, like geopolitical tensions or unforeseen pandemics, pose challenges to accurate predictions. However, by utilizing advanced econometric\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771419658836}}

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 32 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.1%.\n\nParamount Skydance helped lead the market and rose 4.9% after Warner Bros.

Genuine Parts’ stock fell 14.6%\n\nDrops for some Big Tech stocks were the heaviest weights on the market Tuesday, including a 1.2% fall for Alphabet.\n\nThe moves were tentative, though, and Nvidia swung between being one of the market’s heaviest weights and one of its biggest strengths.\n\nMarkets need such Big Tech companies to stabilize and “need to see less sell first/ask questions later behavior from investors,” according to Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nLast week, Wall Street shook when [stocks of software and other companies tumbled](https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-fed-jobs-profit-45f8d8df807d4b7ed9127afc4b5809c9) as investors hunted for companies that could be potential losers if AI ends up remaking the world and their industries.\n\n“Overall, the market is still close to records highs, but it may not feel that way to some investors because of the sharp sell-offs that seem to derail upswings almost as soon as they begin,” according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe market has seen a sharp turnaround from prior years, when the promise of AI helped drive U.S. stock indexes to record after record. Now, companies in industries as varied as software and legal services and trucking have seen investors suddenly turn against them when worries flare that AI-powered competitors could steal their customers.\n\nThe companies spending big on AI are feeling their own pressure, too.\n\nGlobal fund managers say they’re worried about the risk that companies are pouring too many dollars into AI data centers and chips. Those companies will need to see tremendous profits and productivity to make their investments worth it. Alphabet, for example, said its spending on AI and other investments could double this year to roughly $180 billion.\n\nA survey of global fund managers by Bank of America found a record percentage is saying that companies are “overinvesting.” That could mean an eventual pullback in spending on chips from Nvidia and other companies.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 added 7.05 points to 6,843.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.26 to 49,553.19, and the Nasdaq composite gained 31.71 to 22,578.38.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.05% from 4.04% late Friday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose in Europe following a quiet day in Asia, where most markets were closed for Lunar New Year holidays.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%. [Weak economic data](https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-trump-takaichi-tariffs-470e69f6d5230d2b419508eec315668e) for Japan appeared to weigh on the market, and a 5.1% decline for tech giant SoftBank Group also pulled shares lower.

The price analysis encompasses macroeconomic data, political events, and technical analysis to facilitate the most accurate trading forecast for the XAUUSD.\n\nThe article covers the following subjects:\n\n* [Expert Technical Analysis for XAU/USD for Today](#h0)\n* [XAU/USD Real-Time Market Status](#h1)\n* [Gold Price Forecast for Tomorrow](#h2)\n* [Gold Price Forecast for Next Week](#h3)\n* [Gold Price Prediction for Next 30 Days](#h4)\n* [Gold Outlook: Market Sentiment and Key Events for the Next 30 Days](#h5)\n* [Price Analysis and Forecasting Methodology](#h6)\n* [Gold (XAU/USD) Price Forecast FAQs](#h7)\n\n \n\n## Expert Technical Analysis for XAU/USD for Today\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows the following signals:\n\n* The price is retesting the lower boundary of the [Rising Wedge](https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for-professionals/100-most-efficient-forex-chart-patterns/rising-wedge-pattern/) pattern (1) in the $4,937.88–$4,996.26 range. An [Inverted Hammer](https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for-beginners/how-to-read-candlestick-chart/inverted-hammer-candlestick-pattern/) pattern (2) reflects an attempt by bulls to push the price higher. A sustained move below $4,996.26 could lead to further declines toward the $4,701.55 level. If the price consolidates above $4,996.26 on increased volume, the bullish trend will likely resume.\n \n* [MACD](https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for-beginners/best-technical-indicators/macd-indicator-forex-trading/) is rising in the negative zone, indicating weakening bearish momentum.\n \n* [RSI](https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for-beginners/best-technical-indicators/rsi-relative-strength-index/) is rising and holding at 46. The price could move in either direction.\n \n* [MFI](https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for-beginners/best-technical-indicators/best-forex-volume-indicators/) is declining, indicating a liquidity outflow.\n \n* [VWAP](https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for-beginners/best-technical-indicators/vwap-indicator-what-is-vwap-in-trading-and-how-to-use-it/) and [SMA](https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for-beginners/best-technical-indicators/what-is-simple-moving-average-indicator-sma/)20 are near the current market price, suggesting temporary consolidation.\n\n### Trading Plan for XAUUSD for Today\n\nGold forecast for today:\n\n* Key support levels: $4,881.57, $4,821.84, $4,760.74, $4,701.55, $4,645.91, $4,576.74, $4,509.74, $4,441.34, $4,373.89.\n \n* Key resistance levels: $4,937.88, $4,996.26, $5,052.87, $5,107.72, $5,153.72, $5,208.41, $5,266.41, $5,320.89, $5,370.11.\n \n* Base scenario: Open short positions (1) on increased volume below the $4,881.57 level, with price targets at $4,821.84, $4,760.74, $4,701.55, $4,645.91, $4,576.74, $4,509.74, $4,441.34, and $4,373.89.

There is no need to refresh your browser. This chart also gives you up to 20 years of historical data, so you can see the long-term gold price trends. Live and historic data is available in seven different currencies.\n\nYou can then use those real-time spot prices to place an order using BullionVault's live order board, selecting your gold market from Zurich, London, New York, Toronto or Singapore.\n\nOn BullionVault you can buy [gold](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/gold) in US Dollars, Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen.\n\n| | Gold Spot Price Today |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gold Price per Gram |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Kilo |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Ounce |   |   |   |\n|   |\n\n| Gold Price Last |\n| --- |\n| Current Price | |\n| High | |\n| Low | |\n| Change | |\n\nThis gold price chart is a live feed of the spot price in the wholesale market. It closes over the weekend and public holidays. BullionVault, on the other hand, never shuts. It allows you to trade gold 24 hours a day, every day of the year.\n\nSet a custom [gold price alert](https://www.bullionvault.com/price-alerts.do) on the website or app to be emailed or notified whenever the gold price moves through your chosen value.\n\nYes, BullionVault gives you direct access to wholesale gold, silver, platinum and palladium at live professional-market prices, starting from as little as 1 gram at a time.\n\nIt's important to understand that the spot price shown above on BullionVault's chart is provided for reference. Like the spot price published by other sources (such as Reuters or Bloomberg) it represents the average of many wholesale quotes, and – crucially – it represents the average of those quotes' mid-points.\n\nSpot, in other words, doesn't necessarily reflect a price you might actually get from any individual bank or dealer, and it cannot reflect the spread between prices to buy and prices to sell.\n\nFor private investors, only BullionVault gives you direct access to that trading spread, enabling you to set or accept prices as you choose using our live [Order Board](https://www.bullionvault.com/order-board.do).\n\nYou will benefit from the lowest costs for buying, selling and storing gold. You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day. Place your order for gold by 2:35pm to secure the daily price shown (11:40am for silver, 1:35pm for platinum and palladium).\n\nNo Daily Price is published on Saturday and Sunday, or on certain UK public holidays.\n\nYes. Ordering at the [Daily Price](https://www.bullionvault.com/daily-price.do) is an easy way to buy and sell gold. Tell us how much you want to trade and we'll do the rest for you.\n\nThe actual bullion and cash normally take two working days to settle to your account. For a purchase, your funds stay in your account and are reserved until the bullion is settled. Likewise for a sale, the bullion you are selling is reserved in your account until you receive the cash, typically after two working days.\n\nOpen orders are only executed on days when an appropriate gold price is published.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is published in troy ounces in US Dollars, Euros and British Pounds (1 troy oz = 0.0311034768 kg). On BullionVault, you place orders in kilograms. We convert the as-published price of gold per ounce to a price of gold per kg and round up to the nearest Dollar, Euro or Pound. We use the same gold price per kg for buying and for selling with no spread.\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day. Additionally, once you open a BullionVault account, you can opt-in to receive the [Weekly Market Update](https://www.bullionvault.com/info/weekly-update).

The precious metal falls amid thin holiday trading, with much of Asia closed for the Lunar New Year. Traders will keep an eye on the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be published later on Wednesday. \n\nMarket liquidity remained low due to holidays in major regions. “With China on holiday for much of the week, liquidity is thinner and it’s unclear whether there’s enough momentum to push prices materially lower or whether dip buyers will be tempted back should we see renewed softness in the US dollar,” said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at Forex.com.  \n\nFurthermore, easing tensions between the United States (US) and Iran could undermine traditional safe-haven assets such as Gold. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Tuesday that both countries reached an understanding on the main “guiding principles” in talks aimed at resolving their longstanding nuclear dispute, but that does not mean a deal is imminent. \n\nTraders will closely monitor the FOMC Minutes for more clues from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) about the future interest rate path. Any dovish stance by the US central bank could drag the US Dollar (USD) lower and support USD-denominated commodity prices in the near term. \n\nRead more\n\n* Week Ahead: What Signals Will Fed Minutes Send?

But with earnings just days away, we do expect to see explosive upside. For one, analysts at Citi just reiterated a buy rating on the tech giant. The firm noted that it’s recommending investors add to NVDA, as the valuation looks attractive and the stock is likely to outperform in the second half of 2026.\nContent:\nThis post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them.\n\nNVIDIA ([NASDAQ: NVDA](https://247wallst.com/companies/nvda/) | [NVDA Price Prediction](https://247wallst.com/companies/nvda/price-prediction)) is sinking today.\n\nBut with earnings just days away, we do expect to see explosive upside.\n\nFor one, analysts at Citi just reiterated a buy rating on the tech giant. The firm noted that it’s recommending investors add to NVDA, as the valuation looks attractive and the stock is likely to outperform in the second half of 2026.\n\nThat’s because its status as an AI leader has made it a key bellwether for all AI stocks. The good news is that big tech companies that operate data centers, or hyper scalers, are saying they will increase massive AI capex this year, with a good chunk of that going to AI. We also have to consider that CEO Jensen Huang has said demand for the company’s new Blackwell platform data center products was “off the charts.”\n\nAlso, as noted by analysts at Wedbush, “Looking ahead to the remainder of 2026 and into 2027, the focus is already shifting toward NVIDIA’s next milestone: the Rubin (R100) architecture.\n\nSolid earnings, guidance, and anything positive about Rubin could ignite a big rally in Nvidia and the overall tech sector.\n\n## **Tempus AI** \n\nShares of Tempus AI ([NASDAQ: TEM](https://247wallst.com/companies/tem/)) are down slightly with other tech names.\n\nHowever, analysts at Baird just initiated an outperform rating on Tempus AI (TEM), noting that the AI company is in an “underpenetrated market.” The firm added that the recent stock pullback creates a buy opportunity.\n\nPlus, earnings haven’t been too shabby either. For the third quarter, the company posted a loss of 11 cents, which beat estimates by seven cents. Revenue of $334.2 million, up 84.7% year over year, beat by $5.53 million. It also raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $1.265 billion as compared to estimates for $1.26 billion, which is about 80% annual growth.\n\n## **Albemarle** \n\nAnalysts at Bank of America just upgraded lithium giant Albemarle ([NYSE: ALB](https://247wallst.com/companies/alb/)) to a buy rating. The firm added, “With lithium spot prices doubling since our Oct. downgrade and now sustaining above $20/kg, we believe the ‘headline-driven’ momentum phase has largely played out,” as quoted by CNBC.\n\nWe also have to consider that the lithium story is getting explosive – again.\n\nFor one, lithium remains one of the most strategically important commodities for the global shift to electrification, clean energy, and energy storage.  And two, demand for lithium is only rising, as supply continues to dwindle thanks to lower mine activity.\n\nIn fact, lithium is shifting from oversupply to a tight deficit again. As noted by Seeking Alpha, “Industry forecasts continue to point to lithium demand more than doubling by the end of the decade, with 2026 shaping up as a key inflection year where demand growth clearly outpaces new supply. Several higher-cost producers have slowed production or paused expansions, while permitting timelines and capital discipline are keeping new mines from coming online as quickly as once expected. As a result, analysts increasingly expect the lithium market to move from surplus toward deficit starting in 2026,” they added.\n\n## If You’ve Been Thinking About Retirement, Pay Attention (sponsor)\n\nRetirement planning doesn’t have to feel overwhelming.

However, the current premarket trend indicates a return to growth-oriented sectors, provided today&#x27;s economic data and central bank insights support a &quot;soft landing&quot; narrative.\nContent:\n## Premarket Activity and Futures\n\nU.S. stock futures are trending higher on Wednesday morning, February 18, 2026, as investors shake off recent volatility tied to artificial intelligence (AI) valuation concerns. As of the early morning hours, [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) futures have advanced 0.6%, while Nasdaq 100 ([NDX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NDX)) futures are leading the pack with a 0.7% gain. The [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) futures are also in positive territory, up 0.5%.\n\nThis upward movement suggests a \"dip-buying\" mentality is taking hold following a choppy session on Tuesday. Market participants are balancing \"AI jitters\"—fears that massive capital expenditures in the tech sector may not yield immediate returns—against a robust domestic economy and the potential for a strategic pivot in global trade.\n\n## Index Performance and Trends\n\nThe major market indexes are looking to build on the marginal gains achieved during Tuesday's session. The S&P 500 ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) currently sits near the 6,843 level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([COMP](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/COMP)) is hovering around 22,578. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DIA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DIA)) remains resilient near the 49,553 mark.\n\nWhile the broader market has been mostly sidetracked by what analysts are calling the \"SaaSpocalypse\"—a rotation out of software-as-a-service stocks due to AI disruption—defensive sectors like Utilities and Health Care have shown strength. However, the current [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trend indicates a return to growth-oriented sectors, provided today's economic data and central bank insights support a \"soft landing\" narrative.\n\n## Upcoming Economic Catalysts\n\nThe primary focus for today’s session is the 2:00 PM ET release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the January meeting. Traders are scouring the text for clues regarding the Federal Reserve's internal debate over interest rate cuts. Current market pricing reflects a high probability of a rate hold in March, but investors are eager to see if officials are leaning toward a June cut.\n\nBefore the opening bell, a flurry of economic data at 8:30 AM ET will set the tone. This includes January Building Permits (expected at 1.400M) and Housing Starts, which will provide a health check on the residential construction sector. Additionally, the Durable Goods Orders report for January is forecast to show a 1.7% decline, a figure that could influence manufacturing sentiment and broader GDP expectations for the first quarter of 2026.\n\n## Corporate News and Major Ticker Movements\n\nIn corporate news, Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) remains the market's central bellwether. Although its official earnings report is not due until February 25, the stock is seeing [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") interest as investors debate its $4.66 trillion valuation. Other \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, including Microsoft ([MSFT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MSFT)), Apple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)), and Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/GOOGL)), are also trending higher in early trading.\n\nA bidding war is heating up in the media sector. Paramount Global ([PARA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PARA)) shares jumped nearly 5% after Warner Bros. Discovery ([WBD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WBD)) signaled it would allow Paramount to submit a \"best and final\" bid to counter an existing offer from Netflix ([NFLX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NFLX)). Meanwhile, Amazon ([AMZN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMZN)) is looking to recover from recent pressure as it navigates the shifting AI landscape.\n\nOn the downside, General Mills ([GIS](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/GIS)) saw its stock tumble 7% in the previous session after warning of \"uneasy\" consumer sentiment, a trend that investors will watch closely across the consumer staples sector today. Conversely, Tesla ([TSLA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/TSLA)) and Meta Platforms ([META](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/META)) are seeing modest gains as risk appetite returns.\n\nFinally, international developments are providing a tailwind for industrial stocks. A landmark $550 billion Japan-U.S. trade deal announced by the administration is expected to revitalize the American industrial base, benefiting companies with heavy manufacturing footprints. While SoftBank Group ([SFTBY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SFTBY)) fell on news related to its energy subsidiaries, the broader sentiment regarding U.S.-Japan cooperation is viewed as \n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: Biggest stock movers Tuesday: ZIM, CMPS, DHR, and more | Seeking Alpha\nLink: https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552340-biggest-stock-movers-tuesday-zim-cmps-and-more\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: Stock market movers: futures dip in a holiday week as <strong>ZIM soars on a $4.2B buyout, biotechs rally on Phase 3 data, and WPM slides on a $4.3B deal</strong>—read now.\nContent:\n* [\n \n Comments\n \n (12)\n \n \n \n ](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552340-biggest-stock-movers-tuesday-zim-cmps-and-more#scroll_comments)\n\n![Technical Price Chart Data Analysis Showing 2020 Corona Virus Covid-19 Stock Market Crash](https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1211990695/image_1211990695.jpg?io=getty-c-w630)\n\nStock futures were slightly higher on Tuesday amid a holiday-shortened trading week, spotlighting key economic data and corporate earnings ahead.\n\nHere are some of Tuesday's biggest stock movers:\n\n## Biggest stock gainers\n\n* **ZIM Integrated Shipping ([ZIM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZIM \"ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd.\")) +31%** - Shares jumped after Hapag-Lloyd ([HPGLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPGLY \"Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft\")\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: Apple, General Electric among market cap stock movers on Tuesday By Investing.com\nLink: https://ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-general-electric-among-market-cap-stock-movers-on-tuesday-93CH-4462561\nAge: 18 hours ago\nSnippet: Below are highlights of some of the biggest stock movers, from mega-caps to small caps.

Pre-market futures signal optimism, but the \"SaaSpocalypse\" rotation—fears that AI will disrupt traditional software businesses—continues to weigh on tech sentiment. BofA's latest fund manager survey triggered a contrarian \"sell signal\" with bullishness at levels last seen in June 2021.\n\n**Key Themes:** \n- **AI Crossroads:** Markets grappling with massive tech capex ($180B from Alphabet alone) versus uncertain ROI. Nvidia's Feb 25 earnings will be critical for sector direction.\n- **Fed Path:** FOMC minutes today will clarify whether officials favor additional rate cuts in 2026. Citigroup economists see \"a clear path\" for further cuts as inflation cools and employment normalizes.\n- **Consumer Caution:** General Mills' warning about \"uneasy\" consumers echoes broader concerns about spending sustainability despite low unemployment (4.3%).\n- **Liquidity Vacuum:** Lunar New Year closures across Asia (especially China's gold market shutdown) creating thin trading conditions and exaggerated price moves.\n\n**Watch For:** Housing data at 8:30 AM ET could set the tone; strong numbers would support \"soft landing\" narrative. FOMC minutes at 2 PM ET are the day's main event—any dovish hints could rally bonds and pressure the dollar. Durable Goods Orders will provide manufacturing sector health check.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
