Following a volatile session on Thursday that saw major benchmarks retreat, futures tied to the [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) are up 0.24%, while Nasdaq 100 futures have advanced 0.35%. The [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DIA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DIA)) futures are also trending higher, gaining approximately 0.16% in early trading. This cautious optimism comes as market participants await the \"double-header\" of the fourth-quarter GDP advance reading and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\n## Major Index Performance and Trends\n\nThe current market environment is characterized by a \"wait-and-see\" approach after the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) tumbled 0.5% to close at 49,395.16 in the previous session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([IXIC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/IXIC)) and the S&P 500 ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) also faced pressure, sliding 0.3% and 0.28% respectively. Despite these setbacks, the broader trend for 2026 remains one of selective rotation. While mega-cap technology shares have faced valuation scrutiny, energy and industrial sectors have found support from rising crude oil prices and robust machinery demand. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) remains elevated at 20.23, reflecting heightened anxiety over geopolitical developments and the long-term path of interest rates.\n\n## Upcoming Economic Events and Policy Decisions\n\nToday’s economic calendar is arguably the most significant of the month. At 8:30 AM ET, the Department of Commerce will release the advance estimate for Q4 GDP, with economists forecasting a growth rate of 2.5%. Simultaneously, the PCE inflation data for December and January will be scrutinized for any signs of \"sticky\" price pressures. Hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting have already signaled that policymakers are split on the outlook for rate cuts, with some officials even suggesting further tightening if inflation does not cool toward the 2% target. Later this morning, at 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan will release its revised Consumer Sentiment index and inflation expectations, providing further insight into the American consumer's psyche.\n\n## Corporate News and Stock Movers\n\nIn corporate developments, Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) is the primary focus of the technology sector as it prepares to report quarterly earnings next week. The semiconductor giant is currently trading slightly lower in [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") as investors weigh the sustainability of AI-driven profit growth. Apple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)) is also under pressure, falling 1.4% in recent sessions amid concerns over global hardware demand.\n\nRetail bellwether Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) recently reported stronger-than-expected holiday results but issued a cautious profit forecast for the upcoming year, citing \"substantial uncertainty\" in the macroeconomic environment. Meanwhile, Dropbox ([DBX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DBX)) shares fell over 4% in [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trading despite an earnings beat, as its fiscal 2026 sales guidance failed to impress analysts. In the private credit space, Blue Owl Capital ([OWL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/OWL)) has sparked industry-wide concerns after announcing a $1.4 billion asset sale and freezing redemptions in one of its funds to manage leverage.\n\nOther notable movers include Tesla ([TSLA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/TSLA)), which is seeing modest gains of 0.09% in early trading, and Google parent Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/GOOGL)), which remains flat as the market assesses the impact of new AI competitors. Geopolitical tensions have also boosted energy firms like Occidental Petroleum ([OXY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/OXY)), which surged nearly 10% following a profit beat and rising crude prices. As the trading day progresses, the intersection of high-stakes economic data and geopolitical headlines will likely dictate whether the market can reclaim its \n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771592456397}}

This represents a substantial downward adjustment from September’s 30% estimate, as reported by financial news service Walter ...\nContent:\nNEW YORK, March 2025 – In a significant revision that signals growing confidence in economic stability, Standard & Poor’s has dramatically lowered its US recession probability forecast. The global ratings agency now projects just a 20-25% chance of economic contraction within the next twelve months. This represents a substantial downward adjustment from September’s 30% estimate, as reported by financial news service Walter Bloomberg. The revised assessment arrives amid shifting economic indicators and policy developments that suggest stronger-than-expected resilience in the world’s largest economy.\n\n## S&P Lowers US Recession Probability: Analyzing the Shift\n\nStandard & Poor’s updated projection reflects a comprehensive reassessment of multiple economic variables. The agency’s economists have carefully evaluated recent data trends that collectively point toward reduced recession risks. Consequently, their models now incorporate more favorable labor market conditions, moderating inflation pressures, and sustained consumer spending patterns. This analytical shift represents one of the most notable economic forecast revisions in recent quarters. Furthermore, it aligns with a broader trend among financial institutions that have gradually tempered their recession warnings throughout early 2025.\n\nThe methodology behind S&P’s probability assessment involves sophisticated economic modeling. Analysts examine leading indicators, financial market signals, and historical patterns. They particularly focus on yield curve dynamics, manufacturing activity, and housing market trends. Additionally, they assess consumer confidence surveys and business investment plans. The 5-10 percentage point reduction in recession probability stems from improvements across several of these metrics. For instance, recent employment reports have consistently exceeded expectations. Similarly, inflation data has shown more rapid cooling than many economists predicted just months ago.\n\n## Economic Context and Comparative Analysis\n\nTo understand the significance of S&P’s revised forecast, we must examine the broader economic landscape. The United States economy has demonstrated remarkable durability through multiple challenges since 2020. Initially, many analysts predicted a inevitable recession following aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. However, the economy has continued expanding, albeit at a moderated pace. This resilience has forced numerous forecasters to reconsider their assumptions about economic cycles and policy impacts.\n\nComparative analysis reveals how S&P’s assessment positions against other major institutions:\n\n| Institution | Current Recession Probability | Previous Forecast (Sep 2024) | Key Reasoning |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Standard & Poor’s | 20-25% | 30% | Improved labor, moderating inflation |\n| Goldman Sachs | 15% | 20% | Strong consumer balance sheets |\n| Morgan Stanley | 25% | 35% | Easing financial conditions |\n| Bloomberg Economics | 30% | 40% | Slower but positive growth |\n\nThis table illustrates the general trend toward more optimistic assessments. Notably, S&P’s current forecast sits near the middle of the range among major analysts. The convergence toward lower probabilities suggests growing consensus about economic resilience. However, differences remain regarding the precise level of risk and the primary factors driving improved outlooks.\n\n### Key Factors Driving the Improved Outlook\n\nSeveral interconnected developments have contributed to S&P’s more favorable assessment. First, labor market conditions have remained surprisingly robust. Unemployment has stayed near historical lows while wage growth has moderated from peak levels. This combination supports consumer spending without exacerbating inflationary pressures. Second, inflation metrics have shown consistent improvement. Both headline and core inflation measures have declined toward the Federal Reserve’s target range. Consequently, this reduces pressure for additional aggressive interest rate hikes that could trigger economic contraction.\n\nThird, consumer spending patterns have demonstrated unexpected durability. Household balance sheets remain relatively healthy despite earlier concerns about depleted savings. Additionally, real income growth has turned positive as wage increases outpace inflation. Fourth, business investment has shown signs of stabilization after a period of uncertainty. Corporations appear more willing to commit to capital expenditures as economic visibility improves. Finally, global economic conditions have not deteriorated as significantly as some forecasts anticipated. Major trading partners continue showing modest growth, supporting US export sectors.\n\n## Historical Perspective and Risk Assessment\n\nHistorical context helps frame the current 20-25% recession probability. Throughout modern economic history, the United States has experienced regular business cycles. Typically, expansions last approximately 5-7 yea\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: U.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump's tariffs\nLink: https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/us-trade-deficit-totaled-901-billion-in-2025-despite-trumps-tariffs.html\nAge: 18 hours ago\nSnippet: The U.S. trade deficit swelled in December, closing out a year in which the imbalance was essentially unchanged.\nContent:\nA Chinese flag flutters atop a China customs building, at a terminal of the Yantian port in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, Oct. 30, 2025.\n\nTingshu Wang | Reuters\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit swelled in December, closing out a year in which the imbalance was essentially unchanged despite efforts by the Trump administration to close the wide gap.\n\nClosing out a tumultuous year in the global marketplace, the [goods and services shortfall](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/ft900.pdf) in December totaled $70.3 billion, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That marked an increase of $17.3 billion from November and was well above the Dow Jones consensus estimate of $55.5 billion.\n\nFor the full year, the U.S. ran a $901.5 billion deficit, down slightly from 2024 but only by 0.2%, or $2.1 billion. The total was also a bit less than the record $923.7 billion shortfall in 2022.\n\nThe report follows a year in which President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) implemented a series of aggressive tariffs aimed at leveling the global playing field. In April, Trump announced an across-the-board duty of 10% on all imports as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at specific countries that had run up surpluses against the U.S.\n\nHowever, during the course of the year Trump softened many of those positions, and negotiations with major trading partners are ongoing.\n\nIn an effort to get ahead of the tariffs, companies front-loaded imports during the first three months of the year. The trend abated following the early effort, with October registering the lowest monthly deficit since 2009.\n\nThe U.S. had its largest goods deficit with the European Union, at $218.8 billion, followed by China, at $202.1 billion, and Mexico, at $196.9 billion.\n\nExports for 2025 totaled $3.43 trillion for all of 2025, up $199.8 billion from 2024. Imports also rose, totaling $4.33 trillion, an increase of $197.8 billion.\n\n![Tariff study fallout: Are Americans footing the bill?](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108267253-17715046221771504619-44108264849-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1771504622&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: US Trade Deficit Widens to $70.3 Billion in December, Topping Forecasts - Bloomberg\nLink: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/us-trade-deficit-widens-capping-one-of-biggest-gaps-since-1960\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: The US trade deficit widened in December, capping a turbulent year of erratic tariff policy.\nContent:\n(HTTP 403)\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771592465956}}

The [2-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US2Y/) note yield was 1 basis point higher at 3.47%.\n\nOne basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nInitial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 14 came in at 206,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That figure was below the 223,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones were estimating and 23,000 less than the prior week's upwardly revised level, offering a positive sign for the labor market.\n\n\"We appear to be in a low hire, low fire environment which is unusual, but it also shows that the economy isn't falling off a cliff,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management.\n\nAdditionally, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve manufacturing index recorded a reading of 16.3, reaching its highest level since September. That was also far above the Dow Jones forecast for 10.0.\n\nInvestors are now looking ahead to the personal consumption expenditures index on Friday, which is the Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge.\n\nThursday's data comes after the Fed's [FOMC minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/fed-minutes-january-2026.html) from Wednesday showed that central bankers were widely in favor of keeping interest rates unchanged in January, but they were more divided on what should happen next with monetary policy and whether to focus more on the labor market or inflation.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts said that solid economic data on Wednesday, including industrial production and housing starts, continued to push yields higher.\n\n\"The grind higher in rates was also supported by hawkish-leaning minutes of the January FOMC meeting,\" they said in a note published Thursday. They explained that several policymakers supported \"more two-sided language\" on future rate moves, raising the possibility of rate hikes.\n\n\"While that's still far from an active call to raise rates, it adds to the sense that most of the FOMC are in no rush to deliver further cuts,\" the analysts added.\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 1-Month Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis (DGS1MO) | FRED | St. Louis Fed\nLink: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS1MO\nAge: 16 hours ago\nSnippet: Graph and download economic data for Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 1-Month Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis (DGS1MO) from 2001-07-31 to 2026-02-18 about 1-month, bills, maturity, Treasury, interest rate, interest, rate, and USA.\nContent:\n**Source:** [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)  \n\n**Release:** [H.15 Selected Interest Rates](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/)  \n\n**Units:**  Percent, Not Seasonally Adjusted\n\n**Frequency:**  Daily\n\n#### Notes:\n\nFor further information regarding treasury constant maturity data, please refer to the [H.15 Statistical Release notes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/default.htm) and the [Treasury Yield Curve Methodology](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financing-the-government/interest-rate-statistics/treasury-yield-curve-methodology).\n\nFor questions on the data, please contact the [data source](https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/ContactUs/feedback.aspx?refurl=/releases/h15/%).

While the pair made progress during talks in Geneva this week, distance remained on some issues, the White House said on Wednesday.\n\nIran is set to submit a proposal on how to resolve their disagreements, a senior U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nIncreased U.S. military activity in the oil-producing region has nonetheless left market participants nervous. The balance of risk tilts to a U.S. strike after market close Friday, with any attack likely to last weeks rather than being over by Monday open, said Rabobank Senior Global Strategist Michael Every.\n\nThat has left oil prices continuing a surge from the previous session amid concern over potential supply disruption. Brent crude futures were up 0.36% at $70.60 a barrel on Thursday while U.S. crude rose 0.43% to $65.47.\n\nElsewhere, stock prices were lifted by renewed optimism over artificial intelligence after Nvidia this week announced a multi-year deal to sell Meta Platforms millions of current and future AI chips.\n\nAnalysts said the announcement lent a much-needed reprieve to technology stocks which had lost ground this month on concern about valuations being too high and about how long it would take for AI investment to boost revenue growth.\n\nOver in the currency market, the U.S. dollar looked perky as minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest board meeting showed no rush to cut the central bank's policy interest rate, with several members open to hikes if inflation proved sticky.\n\nThe minutes highlighted divisions at the bank, particularly as policymakers grapple with the impact of AI on the world's largest economy, with some expecting a productivity boom to ease inflation, while others said heavy AI investment could pose financial risk.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Thursday:\n\n\\* Walmart earnings \\* U.S. weekly jobless claims data \\* Fed's Bostic, Bowman, Kashkari, Goolsbee speak\n\n(By Rae Wee; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: Geopolitics, Tech Gyrations Roil Asian Stock Markets | MarketScreener\nLink: https://www.marketscreener.com/news/geopolitics-tech-gyrations-roil-asian-stock-markets-ce7e5dddda8eff23\nAge: 2 hours ago\nSnippet: Asian stock markets turned in a choppy Friday in thinned holiday-action, as traders cautiously mulled Middle East geopolitics, but a tech-rally fueled Seoul&#x27;s exchanges to fresh zeniths.

You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day. Additionally, once you open a BullionVault account, you can opt-in to receive the [Weekly Market Update](https://www.bullionvault.com/info/weekly-update). This weekly email explores and discusses current movements in silver, platinum, palladium and gold prices and the reasons behind them.\n\nWhatever the outlook, choosing to buy gold for investment can make a good idea for spreading risk across a balanced portfolio. That's because the value of gold bullion has, in the past, tended to increase when other investment assets fall over long periods of time. More active traders can also try to time their buying and selling using this live gold price chart.\n\nHistorical trends show that investing in gold has made a good if imperfect hedge against poor performance from currencies, shares, bonds and real estate. The idea is to reduce overall losses by using gold to diversify the portfolio's investments across time.\n\nWhen investing in gold as a way to spread risk, its a good idea to think about costs, security and simplicity. BullionVault addresses these issues to make buying gold [cheaper, safer and easier](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/cheaper-safer-easier).\n\nLooking at past performance, gold priced in US Dollars rose above $2000 per ounce for the first time in August 2020, jumping as the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent global economic crisis drove investors to seek safety in physical bullion. Gold then regained that level, and also set fresh all-time records in Euros, UK Pounds, Japanese Yen and most other major currencies during the Russian invasion of Ukraine starting in late-February 2022.\n\nGold bullion is traditionally seen as an insurance policy during economic, financial and even social uncertainty.\n\nTrack the changing price of gold, as well as historic trends for the last 20 years, using [BullionVault's live gold price chart](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-price/gold-price-per-gram) above.\n\nThe future price of gold is difficult to predict, as bullion prices can fluctuate by the second, let alone from year to year. As with any investment, it is not possible to create a 100% reliable projection or forecast for future performance.\n\nHowever, it's possible to view historic and real-time prices using BullionVault's gold price chart above. Looking at the 20-year view, you can see that gold prices reached all-time highs in the US Dollar, Sterling and Euro, in July 2020.\n\nAlthough we cannot predict future bullion prices, historic trends indicate that investing in gold has often made a good hedge for times when other traditional investments like stocks and shares have struggled. See our interactive table to [compare 50 years of assets performance](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/annual-asset-performance-comparison#table).\n\nTrack the changing price of gold, as well as historic trends, using [BullionVault's live gold price chart](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-price/gold-price-per-gram) above.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day.

Gold in recent weeks has traded more like a meme stock than a safe haven, with enormous volatility and swings in prices.\nContent:\nOil prices jumped Thursday to their highest level in nearly seven months and investors snapped up safe havens like gold, as tensions between the United States and Iran continue to flare.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, rose 1.86%, to $71.66 per barrel. US crude rose 1.9%, to $66.43 per barrel. Oil prices extended gains after rising more than 4% Wednesday and posting their biggest single-day jump since October.\n\nGold, usually considered a haven amid uncertainty, rose 2% Wednesday and reclaimed $5,000 a troy ounce. Gold prices wavered and rose 0.2% Thursday.\n\nUS and Iranian envoys met in [Geneva](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/17/world/video/geneva-diplomatic-talks-ldn-digvid-vrtc) in recent days for negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday said Iranian negotiators did not acknowledge some of President Donald Trump’s “[red lines](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-iran-talks-02-17-26?post-id=cmlr27zqc00003b64sk8mhonx)” in negotiations.\n\nThe negotiations come as the United States has moved military assets closer to the Middle East. The prospect of conflict in Iran has stoked nerves about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and a corresponding surge in oil prices.\n\n“The renewed geopolitical tension between the US and Iran is now clearly feeding into prices,” Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, said in a note.\n\nGold in recent weeks has traded [more like a meme stock than a safe haven](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/gold-prices-meme-stocks), with enormous volatility and swings in prices. But the rising tensions in the Middle East sparked a fresh bid for haven assets, lifting the metal’s price above the $5,000 threshold.\n\nWhen tensions are brewing between the United States and Iran, the spotlight turns to the [Strait of Hormuz](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/23/business/strait-of-hormuz-iran-israel-explainer-intl-hnk). The narrow waterway off the coast of Iran is a critical chokepoint for the flow of the global oil supply.\n\nAbout 20 million barrels of oil flow through the strait every day, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which is equivalent to 20% of global oil consumption.\n\n“The latest move \\[in oil prices\\] signals a market strengthening an already notable geopolitical risk premium as the world’s most important oil artery once again sits within striking distance of a conflict,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.\n\nIran in recent days said it [partially closed the Strait of Hormuz](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-iran-talks-02-17-26?post-id=cmlqfx1qp00143b6nxe9oivvk) for planned naval exercises, according to Iranian media.\n\nMarkets tend to shrug off geopolitical tensions. However, that dynamic begins to shift when geopolitical conflict can directly impact the global oil market, which influences consumer prices and business decisions across the globe.\n\nVenezuela, for example, is not a significant enough player in the global oil market for the [US’ capture of Nicolás Maduro](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/venezuela-explosions-caracas-intl-hnk-01-03-26) to cause market jitters. But investors begin to grow wary with Iran, due to its proximity to the key chokepoint for the global market.\n\n“In energy markets, probabilities matter, especially when the potential disruption involves a major oil producer and a critical global transit route,” Hathorn at Capital.com said.\n\n“Oil markets are starting to price in higher risk as Iran remains a major producer, and more importantly, sits at the heart of the Strait of Hormuz,” she said. “Even limited disruption or credible threats to shipping lanes could cause an immediate supply shock.”\n\nThe Strait of Hormuz is key to Iran’s oil exports, and disruption to the flow of oil would hamper Iran’s exporting business in addition to countries like China that source much of their oil from Iran.\n\nThe prospect of conflict in Iran raises fears about shocks to oil supply, which could send prices soaring. Higher oil prices can raise consumer prices and contribute to inflation.\n\n“More immediately, strikes on Iran would risk causing oil prices to jump and threaten to boost inflation in much of the world, reducing the pace or number of interest rate cuts by major central banks,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note.\n\nUS stocks ended the day lower Thursday. The Dow fell 268 points, or 0.54%. The S&P 500 fell 0.28%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.31%.\n\n“Given that inflation and affordability are front and center for the White House right now, we’d have to think that protecting the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz is a priority, meaning that the priority is a diplomatic solution, and if that is not possible, then a military plan that protects the flow of oil as much as possible,” Dennis Follmer, chief investment officer at Montis Financial, said in a note.\n\nWhen conflict between Israel and \n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: 21 ounces of Gold Price Today in USD｜Gold Price Calculator\nLink: https://www.bitget.com/stock/gold-price-calculator/21-ounce-in-usd\nAge: 15 hours ago\nSnippet: The calculation updates in real time, allowing you to quickly estimate the value of gold without manual calculations.

Following a volatile session on Thursday that saw major benchmarks retreat, futures tied to the [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) are up 0.24%, while Nasdaq 100 futures have advanced 0.35%. The [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DIA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DIA)) futures are also trending higher, gaining approximately 0.16% in early trading. This cautious optimism comes as market participants await the \"double-header\" of the fourth-quarter GDP advance reading and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.\n\n## Major Index Performance and Trends\n\nThe current market environment is characterized by a \"wait-and-see\" approach after the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) tumbled 0.5% to close at 49,395.16 in the previous session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([IXIC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/IXIC)) and the S&P 500 ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) also faced pressure, sliding 0.3% and 0.28% respectively. Despite these setbacks, the broader trend for 2026 remains one of selective rotation. While mega-cap technology shares have faced valuation scrutiny, energy and industrial sectors have found support from rising crude oil prices and robust machinery demand. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) remains elevated at 20.23, reflecting heightened anxiety over geopolitical developments and the long-term path of interest rates.\n\n## Upcoming Economic Events and Policy Decisions\n\nToday’s economic calendar is arguably the most significant of the month. At 8:30 AM ET, the Department of Commerce will release the advance estimate for Q4 GDP, with economists forecasting a growth rate of 2.5%. Simultaneously, the PCE inflation data for December and January will be scrutinized for any signs of \"sticky\" price pressures. Hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting have already signaled that policymakers are split on the outlook for rate cuts, with some officials even suggesting further tightening if inflation does not cool toward the 2% target. Later this morning, at 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan will release its revised Consumer Sentiment index and inflation expectations, providing further insight into the American consumer's psyche.\n\n## Corporate News and Stock Movers\n\nIn corporate developments, Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) is the primary focus of the technology sector as it prepares to report quarterly earnings next week. The semiconductor giant is currently trading slightly lower in [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") as investors weigh the sustainability of AI-driven profit growth. Apple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)) is also under pressure, falling 1.4% in recent sessions amid concerns over global hardware demand.\n\nRetail bellwether Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) recently reported stronger-than-expected holiday results but issued a cautious profit forecast for the upcoming year, citing \"substantial uncertainty\" in the macroeconomic environment. Meanwhile, Dropbox ([DBX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DBX)) shares fell over 4% in [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trading despite an earnings beat, as its fiscal 2026 sales guidance failed to impress analysts. In the private credit space, Blue Owl Capital ([OWL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/OWL)) has sparked industry-wide concerns after announcing a $1.4 billion asset sale and freezing redemptions in one of its funds to manage leverage.\n\nOther notable movers include Tesla ([TSLA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/TSLA)), which is seeing modest gains of 0.09% in early trading, and Google parent Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/GOOGL)), which remains flat as the market assesses the impact of new AI competitors. Geopolitical tensions have also boosted energy firms like Occidental Petroleum ([OXY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/OXY)), which surged nearly 10% following a profit beat and rising crude prices. As the trading day progresses, the intersection of high-stakes economic data and geopolitical headlines will likely dictate whether the market can reclaim its \n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Morning Movers: Etsy skyrockets following Q4 earnings and Depop sale - TipRanks.com\nLink: https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/morning-movers-etsy-skyrockets-following-q4-earnings-and-depop-sale-thefly-news\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: ... <strong>Hims &amp; Hers (HIMS) up 3%</strong> after entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Eucalyptus for up to $1.15B ...

Energy was the standout sector with oil prices surging on US-Iran tensions. VIX elevated at 20.23, reflecting heightened anxiety.\n\n**Friday Setup:** Futures showing resilience ahead of critical economic data. Markets await Q4 GDP (forecast: 2.5% growth) and PCE inflation data—the Fed's preferred gauge. Hawkish Fed minutes have set a cautious tone, with some policymakers open to rate hikes if inflation proves persistent.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n- **Geopolitical Risk Premium:** Iran tensions driving oil higher and supporting gold. Strait of Hormuz concerns could cause supply shock if conflict escalates.\n- **Inflation Watch:** PCE data crucial for rate path expectations. Any signs of \"sticky\" inflation could reduce rate cut expectations and potentially trigger discussion of hikes.\n- **Sector Rotation:** Energy and industrials finding support while mega-cap tech faces valuation scrutiny. Market showing selective rotation away from expensive growth stocks.\n- **Economic Resilience:** Strong jobless claims and manufacturing data suggest economy isn't \"falling off a cliff\" despite higher rates. S&P lowered recession probability to 20-25% from 30%.\n- **Private Credit Concerns:** Blue Owl situation raising questions about leverage in alternative credit markets, creating headwinds for financials.\n\n**What to Watch:** GDP and PCE readings at 8:30 AM ET are market-moving events. Strong growth + sticky inflation = hawkish for Fed = pressure on rate-sensitive assets. Oil prices and Iran developments remain key overnight risk. Nvidia earnings next week will be critical for tech sector direction.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
