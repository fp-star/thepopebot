Investors are returning to their desks with a heavy focus on the technology sector and the evolving narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). [Premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trading activity suggests a cautious but optimistic start to the week, with futures for the major indexes showing modest gains. [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) futures are up approximately 0.25%, while Nasdaq 100 ([QQQ](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/QQQ)) futures have edged higher by 0.38%, reflecting continued interest in high-growth tech names despite recent volatility.\n\n## Market Index Performance and Trends\n\nAs the opening bell approaches, the S&P 500 ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) remains within a critical consolidation range between 6,500 and 7,000. Technical analysts are closely watching the 50-day moving average, which the index recently slipped below, signaling a potential shift in short-term momentum. The Nasdaq Composite ([IXIC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/IXIC)) has shown more resilience in early 2026, though it faces headwinds from a rotation out of \"infrastructure\" AI plays and into \"application\" AI companies. Meanwhile, the [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) continues to track the broader industrial and financial sentiment, which has been buoyed by steady, albeit slower, economic growth.\n\n## Upcoming Market Events and Economic Data\n\nThe economic calendar for this shortened trading week is packed with high-impact events. On Wednesday, the market will digest the minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which investors hope will provide clarity on the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. Current sentiment suggests the Fed remains in \"no hurry\" to adjust rates further, as inflation data—specifically the Consumer Price Index (CPI)—has shown \"sticky\" characteristics in early 2026.\n\nIn addition to the Fed minutes, the market is bracing for key earnings reports. Today, Medtronic ([MDT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MDT)), Constellation Energy ([CEG](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CEG)), and Palo Alto Networks ([PANW](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PANW)) are expected to release their quarterly results. Palo Alto Networks, in particular, will be a bellwether for the cybersecurity space, which has seen increased demand as AI-driven threats become more sophisticated. Later in the week, the market will receive updates on housing starts and building permits, providing a pulse on the interest-rate-sensitive real estate sector.\n\n## Major Corporate News and Stock Movements\n\nThe AI landscape is undergoing a notable transition. Recent reports indicate that prominent investors, including Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, have pivoted away from \"picks and shovels\" plays like Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) and Palantir ([PLTR](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PLTR)) in favor of established giants like Apple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)) and Meta Platforms ([META](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/META)).\n\nApple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)) is under scrutiny this morning following reports of snags in its long-awaited Siri AI upgrade, which may delay certain features. Additionally, the stock is reacting to news of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into its news promotion practices. Tesla ([TSLA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/TSLA)) is also making headlines as CEO Elon Musk doubles down on the company's identity as a \"physical AI\" firm, focusing on autonomous driving and robotics. Despite this, Tesla shares have lagged recently as investors await first-quarter delivery data.\n\nIn contrast, Rivian Automotive ([RIVN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/RIVN)) has seen a surge in interest after projecting robust delivery growth for the 2026 fiscal year. In the digital asset space, Coinbase ([COIN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/COIN)) is trending higher in [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") sessions following reports of solid trading volumes and improved subscription revenue, reflecting a stabilizing crypto market. Finally, Applied Materials ([AMAT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMAT)) remains a top performer in the semiconductor equipment space, recently receiving several analyst upgrades following a strong earnings beat.\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: US Stock Market S&P 500 Dow Jones Nasdaq: S&P ​500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones set for red opening at U.S. Stock Market as Wall Street investors worry over AI disruptions - The Economic Times\nLink: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/sp-500-nasdaq-dow-jones-set-for-red-opening-at-u-s-stock-market-as-wall-street-investors-worry-over-ai-disruptions/articleshow/128463136.cms\nAge: 1 hour ago\nSnippet: U.S. Stock Market today is heading ... and Dow Jones are set for a tough Tuesday at Wall Street as <strong>U.S. stock index futures edged lower in the pre-market</strong>....\nContent:\nS&P 500, Nasdaq, and [Dow Jones](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/dow-jones) are set for a tough Tuesday at Wall Street as U.S. stock index futures edged lower in the pre-market. S&P 500 futures were down by 0.42 per cent, Dow Jones futures were down by 0.20 per cent, and [Nasdaq](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/nasdaq) futures were down by 0.93 per cent ahead of the regular market schedule.\n\n[U.S. Stock Market](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/u-s-stock-market) is heading for an opening in red as worries about AI-driven disruption unsettled investors after the long weekend, while markets also focused on corporate earnings.\n\nConcerns over artificial intelligence sparked a selloff in software firms, brokerages and trucking companies last week, causing Wall Street's three main indexes to log ‌their steepest weekly declines ⁠since ⁠mid-November.\n\n \n\nPotential ​risks from Chinese AI players also added to the uncertainty. On Monday, Alibaba unveiled a new AI model, Qwen 3.5, designed to independently execute complex tasks. Its U.S.-listed shares rose 1 per cent in premarket trading on Tuesday.\n\nMost ​U.S. tech stocks were lower on Tuesday, with Nvidia losing 1 per cent, ⁠while Microsoft ‌and Apple inched down 0.4 per cent each.\n\nThis week, the personal consumption expenditure report - the U.S. Federal ​Reserve's preferred inflation gauge - will be closely watched for insight into inflation ​and the potential impact on the central bank's rate-cut trajectory.\n\nThe dataset follows a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading last week that slightly raised bets on rate cuts this year.\n\nTraders are pricing in a 25-basis-point reduction in June, with the odds at 52 per cent, compared with a close-to-49 per cent chance a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nCorporate earnings will also be in focus, with Constellation Energy, eToro and Labcorp expected to report results ‌before the bell.\n\nMore than 73 per cent of S&P 500 companies reported earnings this quarter, of which 74.5 per cent posted results above analysts' estimates, compared to 67 per cent in a typical quarter, ​data from LSEG showed ​on Friday.\n\nMarkets await comments from ⁠Fed Governor Michael Barr and San Francisco President Mary Daly through the day.\n\nAmong other movers, Norwegian Cruise Line jumped 10 per cent in premarket trading after the Wall Street Journal reported activist investor Elliott has built a ​more than 10 per cent stake in the cruise operator.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Zim Integrated Shipping soared about 35 per cent after Germany's Hapag-LLoyd agreed to buy the company for $4.2 billion.\n\nMasimo surged about 37 per cent after a report said Danaher was closing in on a nearly $10 billion deal to acquire the pulse-oximeter maker. Danaher lost 4.8 per cent.

Bilanz- und Konjunkturdaten sowie wirtschafts- und finanzpolitische Fakten, Nachrichten und/oder Statements werden als Grundlage zur Beurteilung der charttechnischen und markttechnischen Perspektive des untersuchten Werts analysiert.\n\nHören Sie sich die Audioversion dieses Artikels an (KI-generiert).\n\nDer S&P 500 läuft seit Tagen direkt unter der runden Marke von 7.000 Punkten seitwärts, beim Dow Jones ist es die 50.000, die einfach nicht erreicht wird. Das wirkt wie ein böses Omen … aber ist es auch wirklich eines?\n\nDie [Kursziele](https://www.lynxbroker.de/boerse/trading/traden-lernen/wie-werden-kursziele-festgelegt/) der Investmentbanken für den S&P 500 liegen für 2026 alle über dem derzeitigen Stand, einige reichen bis 8.000 Punkte. Da wäre es ein überzeugender Start in das Börsenjahr gewesen, wenn die ohnehin bereits in Reichweite gelegene „magische“ Marke von 7.000 gleich zu Beginn überboten worden wäre. Aber das scheint sich zäher zu gestalten, als von manchem bullischen Trader vermutlich erwartet wurde:\n\n![S&P 500: Tages-Chart vom 16.01.2026, Kurs 6.940,01 Punkte, Kürzel: SPX | Quelle: TWS | Online Broker LYNX](https://www.lynxbroker.de/app/uploads/2026/01/20260119-s-p-500-tageschart-zoegern-vor-der-7000-marke-ein-boeses-omen.jpg \"S&P 500: Tages-Chart vom 16.01.2026, Kurs 6.940,01 Punkte, Kürzel: SPX | Quelle: TWS | Online Broker LYNX\")\n\nS&P 500: Tages-Chart vom 16.01.2026, Kurs 6.940,01 Punkte, Kürzel: SPX | Quelle: TWS\n\nBis auf 0,2 Prozent war man schon dran. Aber jetzt tritt dieser marktbreite US-Index scheinbar auf der Stelle. Und was das Thema Dynamik angeht, wird es dadurch langsam problematisch. Denn am damaligen Rekordhoch des Oktobers war der S&P 500 bis 6.920 Punkte gelaufen. Jetzt, fast drei Monate später, liegt der Index gerade einmal 20 Punkte höher. Das ist dünn.\n\nKann es sein, dass diese runde Marke für zu viele Marktteilnehmer ein Ziel ist, eine Marke, bei der man nicht nur darüber nachdenkt, Kasse zu machen, sondern es auch wirklich tut? Liegen da so viele Verkaufsorders im Markt, dass die Käufer nicht durchkommen? Und könnte das dazu führen, dass mehr und mehr bullische Trader aufgeben und der Index dadurch direkt unter dieser runden Marke abdreht und eine größere Korrektur startet? Sprich: Ist dieses bisherige Unvermögen, nach oben auszubrechen, ein aus Sicht der Bullen böses Omen?\n\n[Den aktuellen Kurs und Chart des S&P 500 sowie Kursinformationen und alle Aktien des Index finden Sie hier.](https://www.lynxbroker.de/boerse/boerse-kurse/index/sp-500/)\n\n**Expertenmeinung:** Nein, eher nicht. Es mag zwar sein, dass in diesem Bereich einiges an Verkaufsorders den Anstieg bremst. Aber ob die abgearbeitet werden können oder nicht, lässt sich noch nicht abschätzen. Das liegt auch daran, dass am Freitag eine Abrechnung an der Terminbörse stattfand. Hier liefen Optionen auf Aktien und Indizes mit Laufzeit Januar aus. Und anders als bei uns sind die Optionen in den USA das entscheidende Derivat der Privatanleger – und diese Abrechnung muss nicht, könnte aber als Bremse gewirkt haben.\n\nEs wäre beispielsweise möglich, dass Optionsverkäufer, die in der Regel zu den großen Adressen zählen, so viele 7.000er Call-Optionen auf den S&P 500 an die Trader verkauft haben, dass sie ein hohes Interesse hatten, diese Optionen nicht zur Abrechnung ins Geld laufen zu lassen, weil das hätte teuer zu stehen kommen können. Ob die 7.000 ein massiver, nicht zu hebender Deckel ist oder eine eher durchlässige Hürde, wird sich daher erst noch herausstellen, zumal es gar nicht unüblich ist, dass die großen US-Indizes eine Zeitlang unter oder an solchen markanten Chartmarken verharren, bevor klar wird, ob die Reise weitergeht oder, was seltener der Fall ist, eine solche „Big Figure“ nicht bezwungen wird und das dann eine Korrektur einläutet.\n\nRichtig ist natürlich, dass die Rahmenbedingungen problematisch sind. Viele US-Konjunkturdaten der vergangenen Tage waren recht gut, aber keineswegs alle. Die Politik im Weißen Haus wird zunehmend aggressiver und unberechenbarer, das wird auch für die Wirtschaft zum Risiko. Und die offene Gerichtsentscheidung über die Zölle sowie das Sägen an der Unabhäng\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771333248863}}

Last month’s Consumer Price Index measured 6%, down from January’s 6.4%,” as Daily Wire reporter Cabot Phillips noted in an X post. Coverage by all the regime media has reflected this bias. While just under a year’s worth of economic reforms and (disappointingly mild) efforts to hold the line on inflation are showing real progress, the previous four years did major damage to the private, productive sectors of the U.S.\nContent:\nThe latest statistics show the U.S. economy is improving steadily, particularly in the shift from government employment to private-sector jobs and toward new hires going to native-born Americans instead of immigrants. Opinion polls, however, show Americans are displeased with the current state of the economy, and young people are turning toward socialism.\n\nThe smart course for the Republicans would be to pass major reforms to shrink the welfare state and cut federal spending and regulation instead of mildly reducing scheduled increases.\n\nThe concerns about the economy reflect three major factors: one, stubborn economic distortions caused by longtime government policies; two, the lingering effects of acute Biden-presidency price inflation; and, three, dishonest media reporting.\n\nThe [average inflation rate during the Biden administration](https://www.investopedia.com/us-inflation-rate-by-president-8546447) was 5%, nearly double the current rate. Real, inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings in private-sector jobs decreased by 4% while Biden was in office. Home prices rose by 37.4%, sparking a housing affordability crisis. Publicly held federal debt increased by one-third, igniting the price inflation.\n\nThat has changed dramatically in just one year. “Since President Trump took office, headline inflation has been running at 2.4% (much lower than 3% inherited from Biden) and core inflation has been running at 2.4% (much lower than 3.3% inherited from Biden),” [the White House stated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/american-workers-win-big-as-inflation-remains-low-wages-surge/#:~:text=Wages%20are%20rising.,power%20they%20lost%20under%20Biden.) correctly last month.\n\nSlowing inflation does not lower prices however. It only reduces the increases. The Biden-era price rises were worst in basic necessities, and the only way to moderate that is for wages to rise. Fortunately, that is starting to happen.\n\nEmployment numbers confirm a positive movement from part-time work to full-time work and away from the government into the productive private sector. “Initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell by 9,000 from the previous week to 198,000 on the week ending January 10,” the second-lowest number of job losses in two years, and initial unemployment claims by federal employees rose by more than one-third, Trading Economics [reports](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/jobless-claims/news/517387).\n\nThe movement from part-time work to full-time employment in better jobs that pay more and include benefits is of course a highly positive trend. “In December, the number of part-time jobs declined by 740,000, while full-time employment shot up by 890,000,” [Unleash Prosperity notes](https://committeetounleashprosperity.com/hotlines/good-news-on-jobs/).\n\nLabor productivity in the nonfarm business sector [increased](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/prod2.pdf) by 4.9% in the third quarter of last year, with output rising by 5.4% and hours worked increasing by 0.5%. Manufacturing-sector labor productivity and output are rising markedly after declining during the Biden administration. Overall [U.S. industrial production has increased](https://www.haver.com/articles/u-s-industrial-production-increases-in-december-on-utilities-rebound), rising 0.4% month-over-month in both November and December, and [manufacturing output rose](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/) by 0.2% in December.\n\nContinued improvements in employment and private-sector productivity are the real solution to the affordability crisis. In light of those trends, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta raised its estimate of fourth-quarter annualized real Gross Domestic Product growth to an impressive 5.3%. In addition, mortgage interest rates are down to their lowest level since 2022.\n\nNaturally, the regime media are desperately trying to spin all this good news into a mythical calamity, to cast doubt on the conclusively proven value of market-empowering reforms. “CNN, true to form, immediately tried to make a relatively good report out to be a bad one in a January 13 X post: ‘U.S. inflation remained at 2.7% in December, underscoring persistent cost of living challenges,'” Newsbusters [reports](https://newsbusters.org/node/293479/print).\n\nWhen inflation was an awful 6% in February 2023, CNN characterized it as good news, saying, “U.S. inflation is still high, but it’s falling. Last month’s Consumer Price Index measured 6%, down from January’s 6.4%,” as Daily Wire reporter Cabot Phillips [noted](https://x.com/cabot_phillips/status/2011104168367583534?s=20) in an X post.

Attention is now centered on the release of January employment data, followed by consumer price ...\nContent:\nUS Treasury prices moved slightly higher at the start of a pivotal week for economic data, with investors positioning ahead of key reports on employment and inflation. The modest gains left yields about one basis point lower by the end of a volatile session, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.2 percent.\n\nAttention is now centered on the release of January employment data, followed by consumer price index figures later in the week. Together, the reports are expected to shape expectations for the Federal Reserve’s next policy decision.\n\n## Market Move\n\nTreasury yields edged lower on Monday after comments from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett suggested that job growth may slow in the coming months due to moderating population growth.\n\nThe remarks appeared to influence short-term maturities in particular. Market participants interpreted the comments as a signal that upcoming labor market data could show softer conditions than previously anticipated.\n\nBy the close of trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note had declined to 4.2 percent. The movement was limited but notable given the broader uncertainty surrounding global bond markets.\n\n## Data Focus\n\nThis week’s economic calendar includes two closely watched releases. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 4.4 percent in January. The consumer price index report is scheduled for release two days after the employment data.\n\nThe timing of the reports was adjusted following a brief government shutdown, resulting in both major data releases falling within the same week. Investors will likely assess the combined signals from labor market conditions and inflation trends when evaluating the policy outlook.\n\nThe Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at its January meeting, maintaining a target range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent. Market pricing currently suggests policymakers are likely to hold rates steady again at their next meeting, pending clearer evidence on inflation and economic growth.\n\nA summary of key expectations is shown below:\n\n| Indicator | Expected Reading |\n| --- | --- |\n| Unemployment Rate | 4.4% |\n| 10-Year Yield | 4.2% |\n| Fed Policy Rate | 3.5% – 3.75% |\n\n## China Factor\n\nEarlier in the session, longer-dated yields briefly rose amid reports that Chinese regulators advised domestic financial institutions to curb their holdings of US Treasuries. The guidance was described as part of a broader effort to diversify risk in response to market volatility.\n\nThe US dollar also weakened following the reports. While there was no indication of a sudden or large-scale liquidation, the news revived discussion about global demand for US government debt.\n\nChina’s holdings of Treasuries have declined significantly over the past decade. Official US data show that China-based investors now hold approximately $682.6 billion in Treasuries, down from a peak of $1.32 trillion in 2013. That level represents the lowest since 2008.\n\nHowever, some analysts note that Belgium’s Treasury holdings have increased sharply in recent years. Because Belgian accounts often include Chinese custodial holdings, the overall exposure may be more stable than headline figures suggest.\n\n## Global Flows\n\nBroader trends indicate that some emerging markets, including India and Brazil, have reduced their exposure to US government bonds. Analysts attribute this to a combination of diversification strategies, currency considerations, and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nDespite these developments, market reaction has remained measured. Analysts suggest that any significant reduction in Chinese holdings would likely occur gradually to avoid destabilizing global markets.\n\n“If China was to reduce its holdings sharply, yields would likely spike and global markets would experience disruption,” one market strategist noted. “Current price action suggests investors do not expect that scenario.”\n\nA comparison of Chinese Treasury holdings over time illustrates the trend:\n\n| Period | Holdings |\n| --- | --- |\n| Late 2013 Peak | $1.32 trillion |\n| Current Level | $682.6 billion |\n\nChina remains the third-largest foreign holder of US Treasuries, behind Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\n## External Pressures\n\nUS bond markets also experienced spillover effects from political developments in the United Kingdom, where government bond yields rose amid domestic policy uncertainty. In addition, Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, conducted a large multi-currency bond sale, adding supply to global debt markets.\n\nThese factors contributed to intraday volatility before yields ultimately settled slightly lower.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe direction of Treasury yields in the near term will likely depend on the tone of this week’s economic data. A weaker-than-expected employment report could reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep policy steady or potentially ease later in the year. Conversely, stronger labor data or persistent inflation c\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Wall Street Ends Volatile Week Mixed as Inflation Eases and Bond Yields Fall | Capital Market News - Business Standard\nLink: https://www.business-standard.com/markets/capital-market-news/wall-street-ends-volatile-week-mixed-as-inflation-eases-and-bond-yields-fall-126021600203_1.html\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: The milder inflation reading spurred optimism that the Federal Reserve could maintain a gradual easing bias, leading to a further drop in Treasury yields.

The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.2% in January versus expectations for a 0.3% increase while the annual inflation rate eased to 2.4% from 2.7%, coming in below forecasts. Core prices rose 0.3% month-over-month, matching estimates, with the annual core rate edging down to 2.5%.\n\nThe milder inflation reading spurred optimism that the Federal Reserve could maintain a gradual easing bias, leading to a further drop in Treasury yields. Daniela Hathorn of Capital.com noted that the data reduces the risk of a hawkish Fed shift despite a resilient labour market. However, persistent concerns about excessive spending and potential disruptions from the on-going artificial intelligence build out weighed on investor sentiment, limiting buying interest across markets.\n\nGold stocks moved sharply higher along with the price of the previous metal, resulting in a 5.6% spike by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index. Computer hardware stocks were considerably strong as reflected by the 2.7% surge by the NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index. Networking, utilities, natural gas and transportation stocks also turned in strong performances while steel stocks moved to the downside amid a report President Donald Trump plans to roll back tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nAsia-Pacific stocks moved sharply lower.

On a year-on-year basis, prices climbed 2.4%, slightly below economists’ expectations of a 2.5% increase. The release of the report was slightly delayed due to last week’s three-day shutdown of the federal government.\n\nFinancial markets reacted cautiously to the data.

[Europe posted small gains](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-gain-bonds-steady-holiday-124715230.html), and NatWest Group Plc climbed about 4% after Citigroup Inc. raised its price target on the UK lender.\n\n“The backdrop for equities is positive post CPI,” said Andrea Gabellone, head of global equities at KBC Securities. “More dispersion” could follow as investors reassess AI-linked sectors, he said.\n\nThin volumes shaped the session. The United States market holiday reduced participation. Mainland China also remained closed for the Lunar New Year break, which limited regional trading flows.\n\n## **Fed Rate-Cut Expectations Anchor Bonds and Guide the Week**\n\nTreasury trading stayed calm after yields hit their lowest levels since December on Friday. The 10-year US yield held near 4.05% in the latest session. Germany’s 10-year yield eased to 2.74%, and the United Kingdom’s fell to 4.39%.\n\nInflation data helped cement the rate outlook. Traders fully priced a first Fed cut for July. They also kept a strong probability in June, based on the market positioning described in the wrap.\n\nFriday’s bond rally led to shorter maturities, which react faster to [Fed policy shifts](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/business/gold-price-today-mcx-gold-slides-nearly-3-as-profit-booking-intensifies-amid-margin-hike-and-hawkish-fed-signals). The two-year Treasury yield fell toward 3.4%, marking the lowest level since October. It also marked its lowest closing level since 2022, according to the rate-cut positioning analysis.\n\nAttention now shifts to near-term US data and policy signals. ADP’s next NER Pulse is scheduled for February 17. Investors also expect minutes from the Fed’s January meeting this week.\n\n## **AI-Driven Rotation Weighs on NASDAQ as Gold Slips Below $5,000**\n\nTechnology shares remained sensitive to the AI trade’s cross-currents. [NASDAQ 100](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/stocks/us-stock-market-today-sp-500-and-nasdaq-rise-ahead-of-cpi-as-jobless-claims-dip-and-housing-data-weakens) futures fell 0.5%. Strategists warned that AI could disrupt some workflows and pressure revenues in exposed sectors.\n\nBanks also built products around the split. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. launched a software pair-trade basket. The basket goes to long-term firms, seen as harder for AI to displace. It shortens businesses viewed as more exposed to automation.\n\nGold slipped below $5,000 as traders took profits after Friday’s jump. Lighter holiday dealing amplified moves. Crypto also stayed under pressure after a weekend rally faded, leaving Bitcoin volatile. \n\n## **Corporate Movers: Deal Talk, AI Upgrades, and Analyst Calls**\n\n* Warner Bros. Discovery weighed reopening sale talks with [Paramount Skydance](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/news/paramount-skydance-targets-3billion-savings-while-expanding-programming-budget) after a revised hostile offer surfaced.\n \n* The possible studio deal could trigger a renewed bidding contest with Netflix for control of the asset.\n \n* Alibaba Group Holding launched a major upgrade of its flagship AI model.\n \n* NatWest Group jumped about 4% after Citigroup lifted its price target to a Street-high.\n \n* Citi also raised NatWest's pretax profit and EPS forecasts after the Evelyn Partners acquisition and stronger net interest income.\n \n* Orsted rose as much as 4% after an upgrade from Kepler Cheuvreux.\n \n* Volkswagen planned a 20% cost cut by the end of 2028, according to Manager Magazin.\n \n* A group led by Macquarie Asset Management agreed to buy Qube Holdings in an A$11.7 billion deal.\n \n* Norsk Hydro fell 4.4% after downgrades by Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital Markets.\n \n* KGHM slid 3.3% after Citi cut the stock to sell on valuation concerns.\n \n* Pinewood Technologies dropped 32% after Apax Partners ended its possible cash-offer process.\n \n* Goldman also launched an ‘AI-proof’ software pair-trade basket, long perceived winners and short potential AI-disrupted workflows.\n \n\n\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771333268958}}

Like the spot price published by other sources (such as Reuters or Bloomberg) it represents the average of many wholesale quotes, and – crucially – it represents the average of those quotes' mid-points.\n\nSpot, in other words, doesn't necessarily reflect a price you might actually get from any individual bank or dealer, and it cannot reflect the spread between prices to buy and prices to sell.\n\nFor private investors, only BullionVault gives you direct access to that trading spread, enabling you to set or accept prices as you choose using our live [Order Board](https://www.bullionvault.com/order-board.do).\n\nYou will benefit from the lowest costs for buying, selling and storing gold. You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day. Place your order for gold by 2:35pm to secure the daily price shown (11:40am for silver, 1:35pm for platinum and palladium).\n\nNo Daily Price is published on Saturday and Sunday, or on certain UK public holidays.\n\nYes. Ordering at the [Daily Price](https://www.bullionvault.com/daily-price.do) is an easy way to buy and sell gold. Tell us how much you want to trade and we'll do the rest for you.\n\nThe actual bullion and cash normally take two working days to settle to your account. For a purchase, your funds stay in your account and are reserved until the bullion is settled. Likewise for a sale, the bullion you are selling is reserved in your account until you receive the cash, typically after two working days.\n\nOpen orders are only executed on days when an appropriate gold price is published.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is published in troy ounces in US Dollars, Euros and British Pounds (1 troy oz = 0.0311034768 kg). On BullionVault, you place orders in kilograms. We convert the as-published price of gold per ounce to a price of gold per kg and round up to the nearest Dollar, Euro or Pound. We use the same gold price per kg for buying and for selling with no spread.\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day.

Palo Alto Networks, in particular, will be a bellwether for the cybersecurity space, which has seen increased demand as AI-driven threats become more sophisticated.\nContent:\nU.S. equity markets are set to reopen this Tuesday morning, February 17th, 2026, following the Presidents' Day holiday. Investors are returning to their desks with a heavy focus on the technology sector and the evolving narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). [Premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trading activity suggests a cautious but optimistic start to the week, with futures for the major indexes showing modest gains. [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) futures are up approximately 0.25%, while Nasdaq 100 ([QQQ](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/QQQ)) futures have edged higher by 0.38%, reflecting continued interest in high-growth tech names despite recent volatility.\n\n## Market Index Performance and Trends\n\nAs the opening bell approaches, the S&P 500 ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) remains within a critical consolidation range between 6,500 and 7,000. Technical analysts are closely watching the 50-day moving average, which the index recently slipped below, signaling a potential shift in short-term momentum. The Nasdaq Composite ([IXIC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/IXIC)) has shown more resilience in early 2026, though it faces headwinds from a rotation out of \"infrastructure\" AI plays and into \"application\" AI companies. Meanwhile, the [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) continues to track the broader industrial and financial sentiment, which has been buoyed by steady, albeit slower, economic growth.\n\n## Upcoming Market Events and Economic Data\n\nThe economic calendar for this shortened trading week is packed with high-impact events. On Wednesday, the market will digest the minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which investors hope will provide clarity on the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. Current sentiment suggests the Fed remains in \"no hurry\" to adjust rates further, as inflation data—specifically the Consumer Price Index (CPI)—has shown \"sticky\" characteristics in early 2026.\n\nIn addition to the Fed minutes, the market is bracing for key earnings reports. Today, Medtronic ([MDT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MDT)), Constellation Energy ([CEG](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CEG)), and Palo Alto Networks ([PANW](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PANW)) are expected to release their quarterly results. Palo Alto Networks, in particular, will be a bellwether for the cybersecurity space, which has seen increased demand as AI-driven threats become more sophisticated. Later in the week, the market will receive updates on housing starts and building permits, providing a pulse on the interest-rate-sensitive real estate sector.\n\n## Major Corporate News and Stock Movements\n\nThe AI landscape is undergoing a notable transition. Recent reports indicate that prominent investors, including Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, have pivoted away from \"picks and shovels\" plays like Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) and Palantir ([PLTR](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PLTR)) in favor of established giants like Apple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)) and Meta Platforms ([META](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/META)).\n\nApple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)) is under scrutiny this morning following reports of snags in its long-awaited Siri AI upgrade, which may delay certain features. Additionally, the stock is reacting to news of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into its news promotion practices. Tesla ([TSLA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/TSLA)) is also making headlines as CEO Elon Musk doubles down on the company's identity as a \"physical AI\" firm, focusing on autonomous driving and robotics. Despite this, Tesla shares have lagged recently as investors await first-quarter delivery data.\n\nIn contrast, Rivian Automotive ([RIVN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/RIVN)) has seen a surge in interest after projecting robust delivery growth for the 2026 fiscal year. In the digital asset space, Coinbase ([COIN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/COIN)) is trending higher in [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") sessions following reports of solid trading volumes and improved subscription revenue, reflecting a stabilizing crypto market. Finally, Applied Materials ([AMAT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMAT)) remains a top performer in the semiconductor equipment space, recently receiving several analyst upgrades following a strong earnings beat.\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Premarket Movers & Top Stock Gainers - Market Closed for Washington's Birthday - Next Market Day February 17th\nLink: https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/\nAge: 10 hours ago\nSnippet: Premarket stock movers, including top gainers, losers, and most active stocks before regular market hours. 👇 Click the stock row to see why these stocks are moving today.\nContent:\n## Premarket GainersGainers\n\n| %Chg | Last | Symb | Company | Volume |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n88.8%\n\n | \n\n5.91\n\n | [OBAI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/OBAI/premarket/) | \n\nTG-17 Inc.\n\n | 10535k |\n| \n\n63.9%\n\n | \n\n3.95\n\n | [PLYX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PLYX/premarket/) | \n\nPolaryx Therapeutics Inc.\n\n | 6635k |\n| \n\n42.0%\n\n | \n\n4.94\n\n | [RIME](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/RIME/premarket/) | \n\nAlgorhythm Holdings Inc.\n\n | 13399k |\n| \n\n35.3%\n\n | \n\n30.04\n\n | [ZIM](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/ZIM/premarket/) | \n\nZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd.\n\n | 5337k |\n| \n\n34.1%\n\n | \n\n174.59\n\n | [MASI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MASI/premarket/) | \n\nMasimo Corporation\n\n | 150k |\n| \n\n28.6%\n\n | \n\n1.89\n\n | [FRGT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/FRGT/premarket/) | \n\nFreight Technologies Inc.\n\n | 1754k |\n| \n\n24.0%\n\n | \n\n3.00\n\n | [LFS](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/LFS/premarket/) | \n\nLEIFRAS Co.

Analysts at Rabobank International expect <strong>Brent crude to trade around $60 in Q1-CY26, then average $58-$60 for the rest of the year</strong>....\nContent:\nThe uptick in commodity cycle may be over, at least for now, suggest analysts and expect prices of most commodities to remain sideways or remain under pressure in the months ahead.\n\nBase metals such as copper, zinc and lead to iron ore, gold, silver, platinum and palladium – prices of commodities have slipped up to 21 per cent since their 52-week high levels hit in late January 2026, data shows.\n\nGold, for instance, according to G Chokkalingam, founder and head of research at Equinomics Research, that saw a long-term average return of around 6 per cent annually jumped 100 per cent within a year. Investors, he said, got an opportunity to cash out of the yellow metal given the run and they encashed.\n\n### Also Read\n\n“Commodity rally of the current cycle is largely over. The recent fall in metals also coincided with a major fall in crypto currencies and technology-related stocks. It would be an ideal strategy to book profits in most commodities even now,” Chokkalingam suggests.\n\nSince oil and gas prices did not join other commodities in their run up in the last few months, analysts believe they are likely to remain sideways at best, unless geopolitical developments trigger a short-term rally.\n\n“Metals (precious and industrial) are likely to be highly volatile and would ultimately fall at least another 10 per cent in the next 6 months. A possible slowdown in global economic growth, meltdown in major asset classes like crypto and technology stocks could be some of the risks for commodity prices going ahead,” Chokkalingam said.\n\n**Oil & gas**\n\nThe worst hit among commodities has been natural gas that saw its prices drop nearly 62 per cent from its 52-week high of $7.83 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) hit on January 28, 2026 to $2.99 as on February 16, data shows.\n\nBrent crude, too, has slipped around 13.3 per cent from its 52-week high of $78.31 a barrel levels hit on June 18, 2025 to $67.9 now, data shows.\n\nOil prices, said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, could decline since supply is expected to outpace the demand in 2026. For most other commodities, the FoMo effect has played out in the last few months, he said, and every rise in the commodity prices now will be sold into, since at every level investors are stuck and would look for an exit. \n\n“For oil and gas, the only risk seems to be geo-political issues escalating – especially US-Iran in the near term. Natural gas has already corrected, thus expecting it to stabilise. Precious metals could remain volatile with a negative bias, unless some major untoward happens on the geo-political scene,” Baliga said.\n\nAnalysts at Rabobank International expect Brent crude to trade around $60 in Q1-CY26, then average $58-$60 for the rest of the year. “We expect a few steep, short selloffs sub-$55 throughout the year as the narratives around oversupply panic and overshoot,” wrote Joe DeLaura and Florence Schmit of Rabobank International in their 2026 outlook report on crude oil.\n\n**Agri commodities**\n\nIn the agri commodity space, prices of coffee, corn, cotton (No. 2), soybean futures, sugar and wheat have tanked up to 29 per cent in the international markets from their respective 52-week high levels hit in 2025, data shows.\n\nThe fall in edible oils, pulses, coffee etc., said T Gnanasekar, director at CommTrendz, has mostly been on account of lack of Chinese buying due to trade-related issues. The agri-commodity basket, he said, is governed largely by demand and supply dynamics.\n\n“Lack of China in the grains market due to trade deal related uncertainty has impacted sentiment. The road ahead (for prices) will depend on how fast the countries can come up with trade deals. That said, there will be a supply response as well.
