Shares of Zillow Group fell 17% on Wednesday, pacing for their worst day since Nov.\nContent:\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on February 09, 2026 in New York City.\n\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images\n\nThe [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) slipped on Wednesday and snapped a three-day win streak after the better-than-expected [January jobs report](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/jobs-report-january-2026-.html) failed to spark a sustainable advance.\n\nThe blue-chip index lost 66.74 points, or 0.13%, and closed at 50,121.40. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) inched down less than a point to 6,941.47. The [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) dropped 0.16% to end at 23,066.47.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' January nonfarm payrolls report — which had been delayed due to a partial government shutdown that [ended on Feb. 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/house-republicans-reopen-us-government-shutdown.html) — showed job growth of 130,000 last month. Economists polled by Dow Jones had called for a gain of 55,000. The latest figure also marked a sizable increase from December, which was downwardly revised to 48,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate also landed at 4.3%, a bit below the Dow Jones forecast for 4.4%.\n\nWhile the report showed the strongest job gains in more than a year, areas of growth remained concentrated in just a few sectors, predominantly health care-related, which added 124,000 total positions. That was double the normal growth from 2025. Moreover, there is the continuing specter of downward revisions over the labor market, particularly after every month in 2025 saw adjustments lower. With benchmark annual revisions combined with monthly moves through the year, average monthly job growth last year was just 15,000.\n\n\"This is generally a good sign, as you'd expect, but we are certainly not out of the woods yet with respect to the labor market. 'Moving in the right direction' would be a better description. The unemployment rate is gradually improving, but there are still plenty of signs that the labor market remains exceedingly weak,\" Rick Wedell, CIO at RFG Advisory, said, citing a low quit rate as one example.\n\n\"In this environment, it is clear that we still have a long way to go before the labor market can be considered 'solid,'\" he added.\n\n[Treasury yields had initially jumped](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/us-treasury-yields-investors-await-delayed-january-jobs-report.html) on the heels of the report as it at first fueled investor optimism that the economy was on firm footing. At session highs, the Dow was up more than 300 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq jumped 0.9%. However, odds for interest rate cuts from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/) were reduced, which could have thrown a wrench into that enthusiasm.\n\nThe jobs report follows weaker-than-expected consumer data released on Tuesday. That report showed that [consumer spending in December was flat](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/december-retail-sales-were-flat-missing-expectations.html), missing the 0.4% monthly gain expected from economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\n\"After a long period of prognosticators offering a tepid outlook for the economy based on a weakening labor market, this print provides a solid datapoint on the side of robust economic growth, an improving labor market and wage growth that can support consumer spending,\" said Brad Smith, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. \"The Fed will take this point into its calculus when it makes its decision next month on whether to hold rates steady. With its wait-and-see data dependent stance, this will surely put the balance towards a hold.\"\n\nSoftware stocks, which were a [key driver of last week's rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/is-the-ai-bubble-popping-itself-software-rout-raises-concerns.html) amid [fears of disruption from artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/ai-anthropic-tools-saas-software-stocks-selloff.html), came under pressure yet again Tuesday. [Salesforce](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/) was down 4%, while [ServiceNow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NOW/) fell 5%. The [iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IGV/) dropped more than 2%, putting it nearly 30% below its 52-week high.

Shares of digital infrastructure provider [Vertiv](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/) surged 24% after the company posted a fourth-quarter earnings beat and issued a strong 2026 outlook.

[McDonald's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/) turned positive after an earnings beat.\n\nThose moves come after a downbeat trading day on Wall Street, with the 30-stock [Dow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) off by more than 66 points, or 0.1%, while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) dipped about 0.2%. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) ended the day just a tick lower.\n\nStocks ended the session lower after earlier rallying off the back of a strong jobs report. The [January nonfarm payrolls report](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/jobs-report-january-2026-.html) showed sharp jobs growth of 130,000 last month, far above what economists were expecting, and much higher than the downwardly revised December gain. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 4.3% from 4.4%.\n\nThe report was a relief for investors who worried it would show a drop-off in the labor market, following a [raft of recent data](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/a-weakening-labor-market-has-become-the-economys-biggest-threat.html) that's indicated slowing growth in a \"no hire, no fire\" environment.\n\nYet the strong payrolls numbers [also muddy](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/the-jobs-picture-still-looks-muddy-even-with-surprisingly-strong-january-growth.html) the Federal Reserve's interest rate outlook, and could mean fewer rate cuts than traders were hoping for if higher inflation also remains an issue. That underscores the importance of Friday's consumer price index, which could show the central bank just what is needed for its dual mandate to come into better balance.\n\n\"It's going to put a lot of weight on Friday's CPI report, because if that comes in tame, at least the market can understand that the inflation part of the Fed's equation is cooling,\" Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's \"[Closing Bell](https://www.cnbc.com/closing-bell/)\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"And of course, now, if the job market is showing decent strength, it kind of relieves us from a macro perspective, because at least we're not seeing an economic downturn,\" Lee continued.\n\n5 Min Ago\n\n## JPMorgan downgrades Kraft Heinz\n\nJPMorgan says that persistent challenges will weigh down shares of [Kraft Heinz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KHC/) as the company backs away from plans to split\n\nThe bank downgraded the food company to an underweight rating from neutral.

The Nasdaq Composite also saw a slight decline of 0.2% to 23,066.47 points.\nContent:\nU.S. stock futures are showing modest gains this Thursday, February 12th, 2026, as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings and look ahead to crucial economic data releases. This [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") uptick follows a mixed session on Wall Street yesterday, where a stronger-than-expected January jobs report initially boosted sentiment before tempering expectations for near-term Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\n## Premarket Trading and Index Movements\n\nAs of early Thursday, futures tied to the [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average are up approximately 0.3% to 0.4%, after the index snapped a three-day winning streak on Wednesday. [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") futures are also climbing, showing gains of around 0.3%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures are advancing by about 0.2% to 0.3%. These movements suggest a cautiously optimistic start to the trading day, with investors seemingly finding some stability after Wednesday's volatility.\n\nYesterday, the major U.S. indexes ended largely flat or slightly lower. The S&P 500 closed marginally down by less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1% to 50,121.40 points. The Nasdaq Composite also saw a slight decline of 0.2% to 23,066.47 points. This pullback was attributed to a robust U.S. Labor Department report indicating that employers added 130,000 jobs in January, significantly exceeding economists' forecasts and leading traders to scale back bets on imminent Fed rate cuts.\n\n## Upcoming Market Events\n\nThe economic calendar for Thursday is relatively light but includes important data points. Investors will be closely watching the release of **initial jobless claims** and **existing home sales data** later today. These figures will provide further insights into the health of the U.S. labor market and housing sector, which could influence future monetary policy expectations.\n\nLooking ahead, the week's most anticipated economic event is Friday's **Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report** for January. This key inflation measure is a significant factor for the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, and any surprises could lead to substantial market reactions. A strong jobs report, coupled with potentially persistent inflation, could further reduce the likelihood of early rate cuts by the central bank.\n\n## Major Stock News and Corporate Announcements\n\nSeveral major companies are making headlines with their latest developments:\n\n**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CSCO)) is seeing significant [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") pressure, with shares falling approximately 7% to 8% after the company provided weak quarterly guidance and reported weaker gross margins. This news is weighing on the broader technology sector.\n\n**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MCD)) shares slipped slightly in after-hours trading despite the fast-food giant beating earnings estimates. Investors appear to be reacting to other aspects of its report or broader market sentiment.\n\nThe trading and investment app **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/HOOD)) experienced an 8.8% drop on Wednesday. This decline followed revenue that fell short of forecasts, concerns regarding its 2026 expense outlook, and a slowdown in crypto trading activity.\n\nBiotechnology firm **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MRNA)) saw its stock fall 3.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to review its application for a new flu vaccine utilizing mRNA technology.\n\nConversely, **Kraft Heinz** ([KHC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/KHC)) shares were up 0.4% after its CEO announced a pause in plans to split the company into two businesses and revealed a $600 million investment across marketing, sales, and research and development.\n\nIn the gaming and software sector, **Unity** ([U](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/U)) plunged over 25% in premarket trading. This sharp decline comes despite strong fourth-quarter results, as the company's first-quarter 2026 revenue guidance fell short of consensus expectations.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is buzzing, with **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MU)) being a standout. Its stock soared nearly 10% in a single session, fueling a rally in semiconductor stocks globally. This positive momentum extended to Asian giants like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Micron was also among the top S&P 500 premarket gainers.\n\nOther notable premarket movers include **Equinix** ([EQIX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/EQIX)), which gained 8.64%, and **Sandisk** ([SNDK](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SNDK)), up 6.07%, both among the top S&P 500 premarket gainers.

That report showed that <strong>consumer spending in December was flat, missing the 0.4% monthly gain expected from economists polled by Dow Jones</strong>.\nContent:\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on February 09, 2026 in New York City.\n\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images\n\nThe [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) slipped on Wednesday and snapped a three-day win streak after the better-than-expected [January jobs report](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/jobs-report-january-2026-.html) failed to spark a sustainable advance.\n\nThe blue-chip index lost 66.74 points, or 0.13%, and closed at 50,121.40. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) inched down less than a point to 6,941.47. The [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) dropped 0.16% to end at 23,066.47.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' January nonfarm payrolls report — which had been delayed due to a partial government shutdown that [ended on Feb. 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/house-republicans-reopen-us-government-shutdown.html) — showed job growth of 130,000 last month. Economists polled by Dow Jones had called for a gain of 55,000. The latest figure also marked a sizable increase from December, which was downwardly revised to 48,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate also landed at 4.3%, a bit below the Dow Jones forecast for 4.4%.\n\nWhile the report showed the strongest job gains in more than a year, areas of growth remained concentrated in just a few sectors, predominantly health care-related, which added 124,000 total positions. That was double the normal growth from 2025. Moreover, there is the continuing specter of downward revisions over the labor market, particularly after every month in 2025 saw adjustments lower. With benchmark annual revisions combined with monthly moves through the year, average monthly job growth last year was just 15,000.\n\n\"This is generally a good sign, as you'd expect, but we are certainly not out of the woods yet with respect to the labor market. 'Moving in the right direction' would be a better description. The unemployment rate is gradually improving, but there are still plenty of signs that the labor market remains exceedingly weak,\" Rick Wedell, CIO at RFG Advisory, said, citing a low quit rate as one example.\n\n\"In this environment, it is clear that we still have a long way to go before the labor market can be considered 'solid,'\" he added.\n\n[Treasury yields had initially jumped](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/us-treasury-yields-investors-await-delayed-january-jobs-report.html) on the heels of the report as it at first fueled investor optimism that the economy was on firm footing. At session highs, the Dow was up more than 300 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq jumped 0.9%. However, odds for interest rate cuts from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/) were reduced, which could have thrown a wrench into that enthusiasm.\n\nThe jobs report follows weaker-than-expected consumer data released on Tuesday. That report showed that [consumer spending in December was flat](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/december-retail-sales-were-flat-missing-expectations.html), missing the 0.4% monthly gain expected from economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\n\"After a long period of prognosticators offering a tepid outlook for the economy based on a weakening labor market, this print provides a solid datapoint on the side of robust economic growth, an improving labor market and wage growth that can support consumer spending,\" said Brad Smith, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. \"The Fed will take this point into its calculus when it makes its decision next month on whether to hold rates steady.

South Korean shares hit an all-time high fueled by the global surge in AI-driven chip demand, while Singaporean stocks surpassed the 5,000-point mark as capital flowed into diversified sectors beyond technology. Consequently, the MSCI index of emerging Asian equities climbed roughly 0.7% to a new peak, anchored by a 3% record-breaking surge in the KOSPI.\n\nThe semiconductor industry acted as a primary engine for these gains. Major players Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix saw their share prices jump by 6.4% and 3.3%, respectively, propelling the South Korean benchmark upward for the fourth day in a row.\n\nIn Japan, the financial landscape saw a rare synchronized rally of stocks, government bonds, and the yen as investors reacted to Sanae Takaichi’s historic election as Prime Minister. The Nikkei 225 broke the 58,000 threshold for the first time, hitting an intraday record of 58,015.08 before cooling off to close slightly lower at 57,639.84. Despite the late-day dip, the index has gained nearly 15% so far in 2026, while the broader Topix index rose 0.7% to settle at 3,882.16.\n\nCorporate performance within Japan remained a mixed bag. Shiseido experienced its largest stock surge since 2008 climbing 15.8% on the news of a projected return to profitability.\n\nConversely, Honda Motor saw its shares drop 3.5% following a weak earnings report. Market attention is now shifting toward SoftBank Group, which is expected to release results that clarify the financing strategy for its ambitious AI investment portfolio.\n\n**Most Read:** [**Chart alert: Nikkei 225 bullish acceleration intact towards 60,000 in the first step**](https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/chart-alert-nikkei-225-bullish-acceleration-intact-towards-60000-in-the-first-step/)\n\n## European Session - European shares advance on earnings\n\nEuropean equity markets climbed to unprecedented heights on Thursday, spearheaded by a rally in French benchmarks as a string of upbeat corporate earnings reports bolstered confidence.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 edged up 0.7% to reach 625.86 points, while the CAC 40 outpaced its peers with a gain of more than 1.4%.\n\nSpecific corporate success stories drove much of the morning's momentum. Shares of Legrand rose 3.3% following the company's announcement that the booming data center market is fueling its expansion, allowing for an upward revision of its medium-term profitability goals. Similarly, luxury powerhouse Hermes saw its stock climb 2.3% after reporting consistent revenue growth, underpinned by robust consumer demand in both Japan and the United States.\n\nBroader market sentiment was further supported by a sense of international relief. Investors reacted positively to recent US labor data, which indicated a resilient job market, effectively overshadowing recent anxieties regarding AI-driven market volatility. This shift in focus allowed equities to regain their footing after several sessions of uncertainty.\n\nMerger and acquisition activity provided an additional jolt to the financial sector. Shares of British money manager Schroders skyrocketed 30% after US-based Nuveen announced an agreement to acquire the firm for £9.9 billion ($13.5 billion). The deal, which creates a combined entity managing nearly $2.5 trillion in assets, pushed the broader financial services sector up by 1.4%, making it the day's top-performing industry group.\n\nOn the FX front, the Japanese yen surged on Thursday, positioning itself for its most significant weekly gain in over a year. This resurgence has placed notable pressure on the US dollar, signaling a potential sentiment shift in global currency markets.\n\nThe yen climbed approximately 2.8% against the greenback and over 2% against the euro this week. While the dollar index edged slightly lower.\n\nIn other regions, the Australian dollar reached a three-year peak of $0.7146. This rally follows a series of interest rate hikes by the central bank, which has signaled that more tightenin\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Booming Asian Markets Widen Lead Over US, Europe | Insight with Haslinda Amin 02/11/2026 - YouTube\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7aoSj1gbiI\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: Insight with Haslinda Amin, a daily news program featuring in-depth, high-profile interviews and analysis to give viewers the complete picture on the stories...\nContent:\nAboutPressCopyrightContact usCreatorsAdvertiseDevelopersTermsPrivacyPolicy & SafetyHow YouTube worksTest new featuresNFL Sunday Ticket© 2026 Google LLC\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Asian Markets Trade Mixed Today Mirroring Similar Cues From Wall Street; Higher Start On D-Street? - YouTube\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0QS-esOWfI\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: The Asian markets traded on a higher note today, bucking the trend with Wall Street.

Track the gold spot price in GBP, USD, EUR, JPY, AUD, CAD &amp; CHF &gt;&gt;\nContent:\nBullionVault's gold price chart shows you the current price of gold in the professional gold bullion market.\n\nWe give you the fastest updates online, with the live gold price data processed about every 10 seconds. There is no need to refresh your browser. This chart also gives you up to 20 years of historical data, so you can see the long-term gold price trends. Live and historic data is available in seven different currencies.\n\nYou can then use those real-time spot prices to place an order using BullionVault's live order board, selecting your gold market from Zurich, London, New York, Toronto or Singapore.\n\nOn BullionVault you can buy [gold](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/gold) in US Dollars, Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen.\n\n| | Gold Spot Price Today |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gold Price per Gram |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Kilo |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Ounce |   |   |   |\n|   |\n\n| Gold Price Last |\n| --- |\n| Current Price | |\n| High | |\n| Low | |\n| Change | |\n\nThis gold price chart is a live feed of the spot price in the wholesale market. It closes over the weekend and public holidays. BullionVault, on the other hand, never shuts. It allows you to trade gold 24 hours a day, every day of the year.\n\nSet a custom [gold price alert](https://www.bullionvault.com/price-alerts.do) on the website or app to be emailed or notified whenever the gold price moves through your chosen value.\n\nYes, BullionVault gives you direct access to wholesale gold, silver, platinum and palladium at live professional-market prices, starting from as little as 1 gram at a time.\n\nIt's important to understand that the spot price shown above on BullionVault's chart is provided for reference. Like the spot price published by other sources (such as Reuters or Bloomberg) it represents the average of many wholesale quotes, and – crucially – it represents the average of those quotes' mid-points.\n\nSpot, in other words, doesn't necessarily reflect a price you might actually get from any individual bank or dealer, and it cannot reflect the spread between prices to buy and prices to sell.\n\nFor private investors, only BullionVault gives you direct access to that trading spread, enabling you to set or accept prices as you choose using our live [Order Board](https://www.bullionvault.com/order-board.do).\n\nYou will benefit from the lowest costs for buying, selling and storing gold. You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day. Place your order for gold by 2:35pm to secure the daily price shown (11:40am for silver, 1:35pm for platinum and palladium).\n\nNo Daily Price is published on Saturday and Sunday, or on certain UK public holidays.\n\nYes. Ordering at the [Daily Price](https://www.bullionvault.com/daily-price.do) is an easy way to buy and sell gold. Tell us how much you want to trade and we'll do the rest for you.\n\nThe actual bullion and cash normally take two working days to settle to your account. For a purchase, your funds stay in your account and are reserved until the bullion is settled. Likewise for a sale, the bullion you are selling is reserved in your account until you receive the cash, typically after two working days.\n\nOpen orders are only executed on days when an appropriate gold price is published.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is published in troy ounces in US Dollars, Euros and British Pounds (1 troy oz = 0.0311034768 kg). On BullionVault, you place orders in kilograms. We convert the as-published price of gold per ounce to a price of gold per kg and round up to the nearest Dollar, Euro or Pound. We use the same gold price per kg for buying and for selling with no spread.\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day. Additionally, once you open a BullionVault account, you can opt-in to receive the [Weekly Market Update](https://www.bullionvault.com/info/weekly-update).

These movements suggest a cautiously optimistic start to the trading day, with investors seemingly finding some stability after Wednesday's volatility.\n\nYesterday, the major U.S. indexes ended largely flat or slightly lower. The S&P 500 closed marginally down by less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1% to 50,121.40 points. The Nasdaq Composite also saw a slight decline of 0.2% to 23,066.47 points. This pullback was attributed to a robust U.S. Labor Department report indicating that employers added 130,000 jobs in January, significantly exceeding economists' forecasts and leading traders to scale back bets on imminent Fed rate cuts.\n\n## Upcoming Market Events\n\nThe economic calendar for Thursday is relatively light but includes important data points. Investors will be closely watching the release of **initial jobless claims** and **existing home sales data** later today. These figures will provide further insights into the health of the U.S. labor market and housing sector, which could influence future monetary policy expectations.\n\nLooking ahead, the week's most anticipated economic event is Friday's **Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report** for January. This key inflation measure is a significant factor for the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, and any surprises could lead to substantial market reactions. A strong jobs report, coupled with potentially persistent inflation, could further reduce the likelihood of early rate cuts by the central bank.\n\n## Major Stock News and Corporate Announcements\n\nSeveral major companies are making headlines with their latest developments:\n\n**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CSCO)) is seeing significant [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") pressure, with shares falling approximately 7% to 8% after the company provided weak quarterly guidance and reported weaker gross margins. This news is weighing on the broader technology sector.\n\n**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MCD)) shares slipped slightly in after-hours trading despite the fast-food giant beating earnings estimates. Investors appear to be reacting to other aspects of its report or broader market sentiment.\n\nThe trading and investment app **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/HOOD)) experienced an 8.8% drop on Wednesday. This decline followed revenue that fell short of forecasts, concerns regarding its 2026 expense outlook, and a slowdown in crypto trading activity.\n\nBiotechnology firm **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MRNA)) saw its stock fall 3.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to review its application for a new flu vaccine utilizing mRNA technology.\n\nConversely, **Kraft Heinz** ([KHC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/KHC)) shares were up 0.4% after its CEO announced a pause in plans to split the company into two businesses and revealed a $600 million investment across marketing, sales, and research and development.\n\nIn the gaming and software sector, **Unity** ([U](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/U)) plunged over 25% in premarket trading. This sharp decline comes despite strong fourth-quarter results, as the company's first-quarter 2026 revenue guidance fell short of consensus expectations.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is buzzing, with **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MU)) being a standout. Its stock soared nearly 10% in a single session, fueling a rally in semiconductor stocks globally. This positive momentum extended to Asian giants like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Micron was also among the top S&P 500 premarket gainers.\n\nOther notable premarket movers include **Equinix** ([EQIX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/EQIX)), which gained 8.64%, and **Sandisk** ([SNDK](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SNDK)), up 6.07%, both among the top S&P 500 premarket gainers. On the decliners' side, **Rollins** ([ROL](https:\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Closing Bell Movers: Cisco falls 7% after earnings - TipRanks.com\nLink: https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/closing-bell-movers-cisco-falls-7-after-earnings-thefly\nAge: 13 hours ago\nSnippet: Wednesday saw a replay of the familiar theme, with Energy and Materials the top two sectors on the day and year-to-date by far, while Tech continues to be dragged down by losses in the Software space. Compounding today’s caution was the delayed employment return, which came in slightly hotter than expected – albeit with most of the job gains coming in Healthcare and Education.

Sales from established US restaurants jumped 6.8% in the period from a year ago when foot traffic was dented by an E. coli outbreak, ahead of expectations and the highest since 2023. Earnings, excluding one-time items, also outpaced the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg, as did comparable sales at the company’s two international divisions.\nContent:\n(HTTP 403)\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: These Stocks Are Today's Movers: Shopify, Moderna, Robinhood, Kraft Heinz, Vertiv, Unity, Cloudflare, Kraft Heinz, Lyft, Mattel, and More -- Barrons.com\nLink: https://news.futunn.com/en/post/68770959/these-stocks-are-today-s-movers-shopify-moderna-robinhood-kraft\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: These Stocks Are Today&#x27;s Movers: <strong>Shopify, Moderna, Robinhood, Kraft Heinz, Vertiv, Unity, Cloudflare, Kraft Heinz, Lyft, Mattel</strong>, and More -- Barrons.com · Barron&#x27;s · Feb 11 22:07 · HOOD -8.91% KHC +0.36% MRNA -3.54% SHOP -6.70% LYFT -16.97% ...\nContent:\nUnity Software(U.US) reported fourth-quarter financial results after the market close on Monday.

Wednesday's strong jobs report initially sparked a 300+ point Dow rally that faded by close as investors recalibrated Fed expectations. Pre-market futures show modest gains as markets digest earnings and await Friday's CPI report.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n- **Labor Market Stabilization:** January's 130,000 job gains (more than double expectations) ease recession fears but reduce likelihood of near-term rate cuts. Job growth concentrated in healthcare; concerns remain about sustainability and 2025's persistent downward revisions (average monthly gain just 15,000 after revisions).\n- **Fed Path Uncertainty:** Market repriced March rate cut probability from 20% to ~5%. At least one cut still expected in June, but odds of holding steady have risen to 40%. Friday's CPI will be critical.\n- **AI-Driven Bifurcation:** Sharp divergence between infrastructure beneficiaries (Vertiv, Micron, Caterpillar, GE Vernova, Eaton) rallying on data center buildout vs. software companies facing disruption fears (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Unity). iShares Software ETF (IGV) in bear market territory.\n- **Global Outperformance:** Asian markets extend winning streak (5th consecutive day), with KOSPI and Nikkei hitting records. Semiconductor stocks leading on AI chip demand. European markets also at record highs on M&A activity and earnings.\n\n**What to Watch:**\n- Friday's CPI inflation data (most important near-term catalyst for Fed policy)\n- Weekly jobless claims and existing home sales (today)\n- Corporate earnings continue (earnings quality vs. AI disruption narrative)\n- Treasury yield curve behavior (2s/10s spread widened on jobs data)\n- Software sector stabilization or further deterioration\n\n**Risk Factors:** Persistent inflation could force Fed to maintain higher rates longer. Software sector selloff could spread. December's flat retail sales signal consumer weakness despite strong jobs. Geopolitical tensions (US-China trade truce talks, Japan political transition).\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
