[Premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") activity saw [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) futures inching up by 0.15%, while Nasdaq 100 ([NDX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NDX)) futures rose 0.2%, recovering from an earlier dip. The [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) futures remained virtually unchanged as the market awaited key retail data and labor market updates.\n\n## Major Index Performance and Trends\n\nThe current market sentiment follows a robust session on Wednesday, where all three major indexes closed in the green. The S&P 500 ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) advanced 0.56% to finish at 6,881.31, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([IXIC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/IXIC)) climbed 0.78% to 22,753.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) added 129 points, or 0.3%, closing at 49,662.66.\n\nDespite the recent gains, the 10-year Treasury yield has been a point of concern, hovering near 4.10% as traders digest the latest Federal Reserve minutes. The minutes from the January meeting revealed a \"divided\" central bank, with some officials suggesting that interest rate cuts should be paused until there is clearer evidence that inflation is firmly on a path toward the 2% target. Currently, the CME FedWatch Tool indicates a 94% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged at its March meeting.\n\n## Upcoming Market Events and Economic Data\n\nThe economic calendar for Thursday is packed with data points that could shift the day's momentum. Investors are closely watching the weekly initial jobless claims report, with economists forecasting a reading of 225,000, slightly down from the previous week's 227,000. Additionally, the December U.S. Trade Balance and the Philadelphia Fed Index for February will provide insights into the health of the manufacturing sector and global trade dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, the market's primary focus remains on Friday’s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. As the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, this report will likely dictate the trajectory of monetary policy for the second quarter of 2026.\n\n## Corporate News and Major Stock Movements\n\nRetail giant Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) is the headline story of the morning, reporting its quarterly earnings before the opening bell.

Shares of Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) were trading down approximately 1.5% in the [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") as investors expressed caution regarding consumer spending trends.\n\nIn the technology sector, Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) continues to be a primary driver of market sentiment. The company recently announced a multi-year AI infrastructure partnership with Meta Platforms ([META](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/META)), which will see the social media giant deploy millions of Nvidia chips for its data centers. While Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) shares rose 1.6% on Wednesday, the stock remained steady in premarket trading as investors look toward its own earnings release scheduled for February 25th.\n\nAmazon ([AMZN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMZN)) is also gaining attention after Morgan Stanley reiterated an \"Overweight\" rating, labeling the stock a top pick due to its underappreciated potential in generative AI. Conversely, Palo Alto Networks ([PANW](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PANW)) saw its shares tumble 6.8% in extended trading after providing a full-year profit forecast that fell short of Wall Street estimates, despite beating quarterly expectations.\n\nOther notable movers include Moderna ([MRNA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MRNA)), which surged 6.1% following news that the FDA will review its new flu vaccine candidate.

Job growth was strong in January while the unemployment rate declined. On the other hand, most of the employment growth seen in January was driven by health care; employment declined in several key industries. Moreover, the government revised job data for 2024 and 2025 downward, indicating that employment growth throughout 2025 was much slower than previously believed.\nContent:\n![](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\n## Week of February 16, 2026\n\n* [The debate about the impact of productivity growth on inflation](#debate-about)\n* [The lingering impact of the government shutdown suppresses US inflation](#lingering-impact)\n* [US job growth was deceptively strong in January](#deceptively-strong)\n* [Japanese election heralds new economic policy path](#Japanese-election)\n* [European economy shows signs of strength](#economy-shows)\n\n![](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\n## The debate about the impact of productivity growth on inflation\n\n* The appointment of Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the US Federal Reserve Board has renewed the debate around the relationship between productivity growth and inflation. The debate centers around Warsh’s view that the Fed can cut short-term interest rates because AI-related productivity growth could help suppress inflation, thereby enabling lower interest rates.\n\nThe [Warsh argument](https://www.ft.com/content/9b9cd6e6-a0b9-453f-b293-975a486a925d)—augmented by comments from US Treasury Secretary Bessent—is based on the idea that the current moment resembles the 1990s. As the argument goes, in the 1990s, Fed Chair Alan Greenspan kept interest rates low because he foresaw productivity gains from investments in information technology. Greenspan was correct and, indeed, productivity growth accelerated in the late 1990s. But that didn’t suppress inflation. Plus, the Fed actually raised rather than cut interest rates when inflation started to accelerate, which was itself the result of rapid economic growth.\n\nIn a [_Financial Times_ piece](https://www.ft.com/content/70dc5068-1718-474d-a225-e1ab6df3b40b), Harvard economist and former Obama-era economic adviser Jason Furman wrote that it is true that labor productivity growth can reduce inflation because it enables businesses to boost wages without increasing prices. Yet, Furman also notes that productivity growth leads to faster economic growth—potentially driving increased consumer spending and business investment—thereby creating capacity constraints and causing a rise in prices. As such, faster productivity growth could imply a higher neutral real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate. In that case, the economy can grow rapidly with high interest rates.\n\nGetting back to the [mid-1990s](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS), the Fed’s benchmark interest rate was steady at about 5% for many years—significantly higher than inflation, which was mostly between 2% and 3%. This means that the Fed kept the real interest rate relatively high, certainly compared to today. Moreover, starting in 1999, the Fed began to increase the benchmark interest rate, peaking at 6.5% in 2000. A recession began in early 2001.\n\nMeanwhile, although many analysts expect a productivity boost from AI, there is [considerable disagreement](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/10/ai-chatgpt-claude-jobs-productivity) as to when this will happen. So far, it hasn’t happened. The productivity gains in recent quarters took place only in the technology sector. Most other sectors have yet to see productivity gains or even widespread AI adoption. Thus, even if Warsh’s argument is correct, it might be too early to discuss cutting interest rates due to productivity gains. Thus, an early reduction in the Fed’s benchmark interest rate could lead to higher inflation.\n\n![](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\n## The lingering impact of the government shutdown suppresses US inflation\n\n* US inflation decelerated significantly in January, which could reflect economic weakening, but very likely also reflects the lingering impact of the government shutdown in late 2025. The shutdown [meant](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/2025-federal-government-shutdown-impact-cpi.htm) that the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles consumer price data, was unable to collect data in October last year.  Consequently, it simply assumed no change in prices between September and October. This meant that the estimated inflation level for November was artificially low. But it also means that there will likely be lingering effects from this distortion into early 2026. In fact, [Moody’s estimates](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/heres-the-inflation-breakdown-for-january-2026-in-one-chart.html) that the January annual inflation estimate, which was 2.4%, would be 0.3 percentage points higher at 2.7% if not for the impact of the government shutdown. In any event, let’s look at the data:\n \n *  In January, the [US consumer price index](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf) (CPI) was up 2.4% from a year earlier, with prices rising 0.2% from the previous month. The annual rate was the lowest since April 2025. However, energy prices fell in January while food prices increased sharply.

The AI bump could help offset the effects of the record-long government shutdown, but it likely won't be large enough to signal a major economic boost.\n\n### What This Means For The Economy\n\nGDP growth in line with expectations would indicate the economy is staying resilient despite the uncertainty during the last year.\n\n\"Mathematically, if output grows faster than employment, productivity is rising, possibly because of AI. However, we doubt real GDP will continue growing at 3.0%+ and expect slower growth for Q1,\" Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust, wrote in a commentary. \"It’s much too early to declare the start of a new technology-driven boom.\"\n\nGDP is also likely to fall far short of the [15% growth rate President Donald Trump predicted](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-expects-an-economic-miracle-from-the-new-fed-chair-federal-reserve-warsh-11903498) in a recent interview. \n\nStill, another quarter of solid growth would represent a rebound from the first quarter, when the [economy shrank on paper](https://www.investopedia.com/for-the-first-time-since-2022-the-economy-is-shrinking-gdp-11724764) because companies ramped up imports in advance of Trump's tariff campaign. (Imports count against the GDP in the BEA's calculations.)\n\nAnd it would mean 2025 closed out with an average growth rate rather than the downturn that many experts feared last year when Trump announced his plans to impose tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. Tariffs have still had a significant economic impact, but a pullback from their initial announced levels, along with numerous exemptions, has reduced it.\n\n\"For the full year, estimated growth of 2.2% would mark a step back from 2024’s 2.8% rate, but it’s still a far better outcome than feared at the height of the trade war,\" Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a commentary.\n\nFriday's figures will be an advance estimate that the bureau will revise twice as new data comes in, and will finalize in April.\n\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

While the pair made progress during talks in Geneva this week, distance remained on some issues, the White House said on Wednesday.\n\nIran is set to submit a proposal on how to resolve their disagreements, a senior U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nIncreased U.S. military activity in the oil-producing region has nonetheless left market participants nervous. The balance of risk tilts to a U.S. strike after market close Friday, with any attack likely to last weeks rather than being over by Monday open, said Rabobank Senior Global Strategist Michael Every.\n\nThat has left oil prices continuing a surge from the previous session amid concern over potential supply disruption. Brent crude futures were up 0.36% at $70.60 a barrel on Thursday while U.S. crude rose 0.43% to $65.47.\n\nElsewhere, stock prices were lifted by renewed optimism over artificial intelligence after Nvidia this week announced a multi-year deal to sell Meta Platforms millions of current and future AI chips.\n\nAnalysts said the announcement lent a much-needed reprieve to technology stocks which had lost ground this month on concern about valuations being too high and about how long it would take for AI investment to boost revenue growth.\n\nOver in the currency market, the U.S. dollar looked perky as minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest board meeting showed no rush to cut the central bank's policy interest rate, with several members open to hikes if inflation proved sticky.\n\nThe minutes highlighted divisions at the bank, particularly as policymakers grapple with the impact of AI on the world's largest economy, with some expecting a productivity boom to ease inflation, while others said heavy AI investment could pose financial risk.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Thursday:\n\n\\* Walmart earnings \\* U.S. weekly jobless claims data \\* Fed's Bostic, Bowman, Kashkari, Goolsbee speak\n\n(By Rae Wee; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Global shares advance, while most Asian markets remained closed\nLink: https://www.bizzbuzz.news/markets/share-price/global-shares-advance-while-most-asian-markets-remained-closed-1385806\nAge: 2 days ago\nSnippet: Global shares advance, while <strong>most Asian markets remained closed</strong> ... European shares advanced Tuesday after a quiet day in Asia, where most markets were closed for Lunar New Year holidays.\nContent:\nEuropean shares advanced Tuesday after a quiet day in Asia, where most markets were closed for Lunar New Year holidays. France’s CAC 40 inched up 0.1 per cent to 8,318.51, while Germany’s DAX gained 0.2 per cent to 24,845.47. Britain’s FTSE 100 picked up 0.4 per cent to 10,481.00.\n\nThe future for the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1 per cent lower. Weak economic data for Japan appeared to be clouding sentiment in Tokyo, and a 5.1 per cent decline for tech giant SoftBank Group also pulled shares lower.\n\nThe decline follows a big rally after a resounding win for Prime Minister SanaeTakaichi’s ruling party in a Feb. 8 general election.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 per cent to finish at 56,566.49. Traders likely were locking in profits from the recent gains that took the Nikkei to record levels. Polls show Takaichi’s popularity is slowly slipping, as hopes for economic revival from her plans to increase government spending and cut taxes subside.\n\nIn Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2 per cent to 8,958.90, while India’s Sensex edged 0.2 per cent higher. In Thailand, the SET added 1.4 per cent. Trading in the U.S. was closed for Presidents Day on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1 per cent a day after one of its worst losses since Thanksgiving. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2 per cent.\n\nShare prices have been waxing and waning with fluctuations in confidence over massive investments in AI. Investors are also focused on inflation and how price pressures might affect interest rates. Also, in the spotlight for later in the day are jobs data from Britain. In other dealings early Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 26 cents to $63.15 a barrel.\n\nThe US dollar slipped to 152.90 Japanese yen from 153.51 yen. The euro cost $1.1850 down from $1.1852. The price of gold fell 2 per cent and silver was down 4.4 per cent. Bitcoin fell 01.3 per cent to about $68,000.\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: Asian Stocks Surge as Tech Giants Drive Market Rally | Headlines\nLink: https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/headlines/3810213-asian-stocks-surge-as-tech-giants-drive-market-rally\nAge: 6 hours ago\nSnippet: Tony Sycamore from IG highlighted the necessity for positive news, following recent declines in the tech sector.

Persisting tensions between the U.S. and Iran sustained elevated oil prices, while safe-haven flows continued to uphold gold prices.\n\nMarkets across Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan observed closures due to the Lunar New Year. Nonetheless, the MSCI's broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed by 0.4%, and Tokyo's Nikkei advanced by 0.7%. In South Korea, the Kospi index soared over 3% to achieve a record high.\n\nThis surge in tech came after Nvidia announced a significant multi-year agreement to provide Meta Platforms with cutting-edge artificial intelligence chips.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 129 points, or 0.3 cent, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8 cent.\n\nNvidia helped lift the market and climbed 1.6 cent after Meta Platforms announced a long-term partnership where it will use millions of chips and other equipment from Nvidia for its artificial-intelligence data centers.\n\n“No one deploys AI at Meta’s scale,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. Because his company is the most valuable on Wall Street, Nvidia’s stock was the single most powerful force pulling the S&P 500 higher.\n\nThat performance demonstrated the upside of AI development for the U.S. stock market. But investors have also focused on the potential downsides recently, which has led to sharp swings for Wall Street. Worries are rising, for example, about how much companies like Meta are spending on AI and whether they can make back their huge investments through higher profits and productivity in the future.\n\nMeta’s stock fell as much as 1.7 cent before recovering and rising 0.6 cent.\n\nAnother worry is that if AI succeeds in creating tools to do complicated tasks more cheaply, companies in industries as far flung as software and legal services and trucking logistics could see their businesses get undercut. That has pushed investors to suddenly and aggressively punish stocks of companies seen as under threat, and analysts have likened it to a “shoot first-ask questions later” mentality.\n\nSeveral profit reports from companies helped to lift stocks Wednesday. They continued what’s been a strong reporting season for the big U.S. companies in the S&P 500.\n\nCadence Design Systems climbed 7.6 cent after delivering both profit and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations. CEO Anirudh Devgan credited what he called “the essential nature of Cadence’s engineering software,” even as investors worry about AI threatening to remake the industry.\n\nAnalog Devices rose 2.6 cent after likewise topping analysts’ estimates for profit and revenue. The chip company said it saw record orders during the quarter for its data center business.\n\nOutside of earnings reports, Moderna jumped 6.1 cent after saying regulators at the Food and Drug Administration will review its flu vaccine candidate after earlier refusing to consider it.\n\nThey helped offset a 6.8 cent drop for Palo Alto Networks. The cybersecurity company reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it gave profit forecasts for the current quarter and the remainder of its fiscal year that fell short of their estimates.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 38.09 points to 6,881.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 129.47 to 49,662.66, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 175.25 to 22,753.63.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields ticked higher following reports on the U.S. economy that came in better than economists expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.08 cent from 4.05 cent late Tuesday.\n\nOne report said that industrial production improved last month by more than economists expected. Another said orders for computers, fabricated metal products and other long-lasting manufactured goods rose more in December than economists expected, when not including airplanes and other transportation equipment. A third report said homebuilders broke ground on more new homes in December than expected.\n\nSuch strong data could encourage the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady.\n\nThe Fed has put its cuts to interest rates on hold, but many on Wall Street expect it to resume later this year. The widespread forecast is that will come during the summer, after a new chair is scheduled to step in atop the Fed.\n\nMinutes released Wednesday from the Fed’s last meeting, though, showed many officials want to see inflation fall further before they would support additional interest rate cuts this year.\n\nLower rates can give a boost to the economy and prices for investments, but that comes at the cost of potentially worsening inflation.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.2 cent after the latest update on U.K. inflation bolstered expectations that the Bank of England may soon cut interest rates.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1 cent as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi was reappointed by the parliament following a landslide victory for her ruling Liberal Democrats in a Feb. 8 election. The expectation is that she will push through policies to help the economy and markets.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, several markets were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nStan Choe, The Associated Press.

Track the gold spot price in GBP, USD, EUR, JPY, AUD, CAD &amp; CHF &gt;&gt;\nContent:\nYes, BullionVault gives you direct access to wholesale gold, silver, platinum and palladium at live professional-market prices, starting from as little as 1 gram at a time.\n\nIt's important to understand that the spot price shown above on BullionVault's chart is provided for reference. Like the spot price published by other sources (such as Reuters or Bloomberg) it represents the average of many wholesale quotes, and – crucially – it represents the average of those quotes' mid-points.\n\nSpot, in other words, doesn't necessarily reflect a price you might actually get from any individual bank or dealer, and it cannot reflect the spread between prices to buy and prices to sell.\n\nFor private investors, only BullionVault gives you direct access to that trading spread, enabling you to set or accept prices as you choose using our live [Order Board](https://www.bullionvault.com/order-board.do).\n\nYou will benefit from the lowest costs for buying, selling and storing gold. You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day. Additionally, once you open a BullionVault account, you can opt-in to receive the [Weekly Market Update](https://www.bullionvault.com/info/weekly-update). This weekly email explores and discusses current movements in silver, platinum, palladium and gold prices and the reasons behind them.\n\nWhatever the outlook, choosing to buy gold for investment can make a good idea for spreading risk across a balanced portfolio. That's because the value of gold bullion has, in the past, tended to increase when other investment assets fall over long periods of time. More active traders can also try to time their buying and selling using this live gold price chart.\n\nHistorical trends show that investing in gold has made a good if imperfect hedge against poor performance from currencies, shares, bonds and real estate. The idea is to reduce overall losses by using gold to diversify the portfolio's investments across time.\n\nWhen investing in gold as a way to spread risk, its a good idea to think about costs, security and simplicity. BullionVault addresses these issues to make buying gold [cheaper, safer and easier](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/cheaper-safer-easier).\n\nLooking at past performance, gold priced in US Dollars rose above $2000 per ounce for the first time in August 2020, jumping as the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent global economic crisis drove investors to seek safety in physical bullion. Gold then regained that level, and also set fresh all-time records in Euros, UK Pounds, Japanese Yen and most other major currencies during the Russian invasion of Ukraine starting in late-February 2022.\n\nGold bullion is traditionally seen as an insurance policy during economic, financial and even social uncertainty.\n\nTrack the changing price of gold, as well as historic trends for the last 20 years, using [BullionVault's live gold price chart](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-price/gold-price-per-gram) above.\n\nThe future price of gold is difficult to predict, as bullion prices can fluctuate by the second, let alone from year to year. As with any investment, it is not possible to create a 100% reliable projection or forecast for future performance.\n\nHowever, it's possible to view historic and real-time prices using BullionVault's gold price chart above. Looking at the 20-year view, you can see that gold prices reached all-time highs in the US Dollar, Sterling and Euro, in July 2020.\n\nAlthough we cannot predict future bullion prices, historic trends indicate that investing in gold has often made a good hedge for times when other traditional investments like stocks and shares have struggled. See our interactive table to [compare 50 years of assets performance](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/annual-asset-performance-comparison#table).\n\nTrack the changing price of gold, as well as historic trends, using [BullionVault's live gold price chart](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-price/gold-price-per-gram) above.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day.

The precious metal falls amid thin holiday trading, with much of Asia closed for the Lunar New Year. Traders will keep an eye on the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be published later on Wednesday. \n\nMarket liquidity remained low due to holidays in major regions. “With China on holiday for much of the week, liquidity is thinner and it’s unclear whether there’s enough momentum to push prices materially lower or whether dip buyers will be tempted back should we see renewed softness in the US dollar,” said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at Forex.com.  \n\nFurthermore, easing tensions between the United States (US) and Iran could undermine traditional safe-haven assets such as Gold. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Tuesday that both countries reached an understanding on the main “guiding principles” in talks aimed at resolving their longstanding nuclear dispute, but that does not mean a deal is imminent. \n\nTraders will closely monitor the FOMC Minutes for more clues from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) about the future interest rate path. Any dovish stance by the US central bank could drag the US Dollar (USD) lower and support USD-denominated commodity prices in the near term. \n\nRead more\n\n* Top 3 Price Prediction: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple – BTC, ETH and XRP face downside risk as bears regain control \n* Gold slides below $5,000 amid USD uptick and positive risk tone; downside seems limited\n* Gold declines to near $4,850 as low liquidity, easing tensions weigh on demand\n\n_\\* The content presented above, whether from a third party or not, is considered as general advice only.  This article should not be construed as containing investment advice, investment recommendations, an offer of or solicitation for any transactions in financial instruments._\n\n![goTop](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI0MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDQwIDQwIiBmaWxsPSJub25lIj4KICA8cGF0aCBkPSJNMTAgMjUuNUwyMCAxNC41TDMwIDI1LjUiIHN0cm9rZT0iYmxhY2siIHN0cm9rZS13aWR0aD0iNCIgc3Ryb2tlLWxpbmVjYXA9InNxdWFyZSI+PC9wYXRoPgo8L3N2Zz4=)\n\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI0MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDQwIDQwIiBmaWxsPSJub25lIj4KICA8cGF0aCBkPSJNMTQgMzJWMTBMOCAxNiIgc3Ryb2tlPSIjMEI5OTgxIiBzdHJva2Utd2lkdGg9IjQiIHN0cm9rZS1saW5lY2FwPSJzcXVhcmUiPjwvcGF0aD4KICA8cGF0aCBkPSJNMjYgOEwyNiAzMEwzMiAyNCIgc3Ryb2tlPSIjRjIzNjQ1IiBzdHJva2Utd2lkdGg9IjQiIHN0cm9rZS1saW5lY2FwPSJzcXVhcmUiPjwvcGF0aD4KPC9zdmc+)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAuthor  FXStreet\n\n11 hours ago\n\nGold price (XAU/USD) holds positive ground n\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: 1000 ounces of Gold Price Today in USD｜Gold Price Calculator\nLink: https://www.bitget.com/en-CA/stock/gold-price-calculator/1000-ounce-in-usd\nAge: 14 hours ago\nSnippet: The calculation updates in real time, allowing you to quickly estimate the value of gold without manual calculations.

[Premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") activity saw [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) futures inching up by 0.15%, while Nasdaq 100 ([NDX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NDX)) futures rose 0.2%, recovering from an earlier dip. The [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) futures remained virtually unchanged as the market awaited key retail data and labor market updates.\n\n## Major Index Performance and Trends\n\nThe current market sentiment follows a robust session on Wednesday, where all three major indexes closed in the green. The S&P 500 ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) advanced 0.56% to finish at 6,881.31, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([IXIC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/IXIC)) climbed 0.78% to 22,753.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) added 129 points, or 0.3%, closing at 49,662.66.\n\nDespite the recent gains, the 10-year Treasury yield has been a point of concern, hovering near 4.10% as traders digest the latest Federal Reserve minutes. The minutes from the January meeting revealed a \"divided\" central bank, with some officials suggesting that interest rate cuts should be paused until there is clearer evidence that inflation is firmly on a path toward the 2% target. Currently, the CME FedWatch Tool indicates a 94% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged at its March meeting.\n\n## Upcoming Market Events and Economic Data\n\nThe economic calendar for Thursday is packed with data points that could shift the day's momentum. Investors are closely watching the weekly initial jobless claims report, with economists forecasting a reading of 225,000, slightly down from the previous week's 227,000. Additionally, the December U.S. Trade Balance and the Philadelphia Fed Index for February will provide insights into the health of the manufacturing sector and global trade dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, the market's primary focus remains on Friday’s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. As the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, this report will likely dictate the trajectory of monetary policy for the second quarter of 2026.\n\n## Corporate News and Major Stock Movements\n\nRetail giant Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) is the headline story of the morning, reporting its quarterly earnings before the opening bell. Analysts expect an EPS of $0.73 on revenue of $190.43 billion. Shares of Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) were trading down approximately 1.5% in the [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") as investors expressed caution regarding consumer spending trends.\n\nIn the technology sector, Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) continues to be a primary driver of market sentiment. The company recently announced a multi-year AI infrastructure partnership with Meta Platforms ([META](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/META)), which will see the social media giant deploy millions of Nvidia chips for its data centers. While Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)) shares rose 1.6% on Wednesday, the stock remained steady in premarket trading as investors look toward its own earnings release scheduled for February 25th.\n\nAmazon ([AMZN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMZN)) is also gaining attention after Morgan Stanley reiterated an \"Overweight\" rating, labeling the stock a top pick due to its underappreciated potential in generative AI. Conversely, Palo Alto Networks ([PANW](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PANW)) saw its shares tumble 6.8% in extended trading after providing a full-year profit forecast that fell short of Wall Street estimates, despite beating quarterly expectations.\n\nOther notable movers include Moderna ([MRNA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MRNA)), which surged 6.1% following news that the FDA will review its new flu vaccine candidate. In the earnings space, Wayfair ([W](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/W)), Texas Roadhouse ([TXRH](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/TXRH)), Dropbox ([DBX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DBX)), and Newmont ([NEM](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NEM)) are all slated to release their results today, potentially adding further volatility to their respective sectors.\n\nAs the trading day progresses, the intersection of corporate earnings, labor data, and geopolitical developments in the Middle East—which has pushed WTI crude oil toward \n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Wingstop Jumps on Earnings; Analog Devices Beats Estimates; Bayer Shares Plunge | Stock Movers - YouTube\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8qG1VuzkNA\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: Today&#x27;s biggest winners and losers in the stock market.On this episode of Stock Movers:- Wingstop (WING) . shares jumped in premarket trading after the compa...\nContent:\nAboutPressCopyrightContact usCreatorsAdvertiseDevelopersTermsPrivacyPolicy & SafetyHow YouTube worksTest new featuresNFL Sunday Ticket© 2026 Google LLC\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Stock Movers: Booking, Carvana, DoorDash - Bloomberg\nLink: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2026-02-18/stock-movers-booking-carvana-doordash-podcast\nAge: 16 hours ago\nSnippet: Today&#x27;s biggest winners and losers in the stock market.

The S&amp;P 500 index has gained almost 1% in the same period.\nContent:\nDylan Field, co-founder and chief executive officer of Figma, speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview outside of the New York Stock Exchange in New York on July 31, 2025.\n\nMichael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\n[Figma](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FIG/) shares surged 15% in extended trading on Wednesday after the design software maker reported robust results and quarterly guidance than Wall Street had predicted.\n\nHere's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 8 cents adjusted vs. 7 cents expected\n* **Revenue:** $303.8 million vs. $293.15 million expected\n\nFigma's revenue grew 40% year over year in the fourth quarter, according to a [statement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260218662839/en). The company had a net loss of $226.6 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with net income of $33.1 million, or 15 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nManagement called for $315 million to $317 million in first-quarter revenue, which implies 38% growth. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $292 million.\n\nFor 2026, Figma sees $100 million to $110 million in adjusted operating income on $1.366 billion to $1.374 billion in revenue, which would suggest 30% revenue growth. The LSEG revenue consensus was $1.29 billion.\n\nLately, investors have [become more concerned](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/software-experiencing-most-exciting-moment-as-ai-fears-hammer-stocks.html) that generative artificial intelligence products could weaken the growth prospects of software companies. As of Wednesday's close, Figma shares were down about 35% year to date, while the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector Exchange-Traded Fund has slipped 22%. The S&P 500 index has gained almost 1% in the same period.\n\nCustomers are sticking around and spending more. Figma's net dollar retention from clients contributing at least $10,000 in annualized revenue increased to 136% from 131% in the third quarter, outdoing internal expectations, Praveer Melwani, the company's finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts.\n\n\"If you look at software, not only is it not going away. There's going to be way more of it than ever before,\" Figma's co-founder and CEO, Dylan Field, said in a Wednesday [interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/02/17/figma-announces-new-partnership-with-anthropic.html). But he said the market is \"potentially increasingly competitive.\"\n\n![Figma CEO Dylan Field on the software reckoning](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108266436-17713520741771352068-44076272367-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1771352073&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nThe company, which [went public](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/figma-fig-starts-trading-on-nyse-after-ipo.html) in July, wants to ensure it can benefit as people turn to AI products for design. The [Figma Make](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/03/figma-ceo-dylan-fields-path-from-college-dropout-to-billionaire.html) tool allows people to type in a few words and have AI models from Anthropic and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) interpret the information to craft app prototypes. More than half of customers spending over $100,000 in annualized revenue had people using Figma Make every week during the quarter, according to the statement.\n\nFigma managed to lower the cost of running the Make service for end users by optimizing its computing infrastructure, Melwani said. The company's adjusted gross margin stayed put at 86%, despite that Figma Make weekly active users increased 70% from the third quarter.\n\nSoon Figma will be bringing in more revenue from AI adoption. In March, it will start enforcing monthly AI credit limits for different types of account holders. Clients will pay based on monthly usage or sign up for AI credit subscriptions, according to a [blog post](https://www.figma.com/blog/updates-to-ai-credits-in-figma/) from December.\n\n\"What we've observed is it tends to be a power law distribution, where a subset of users within an organization are receiving outsized value, and as such, are going over the projected limits that we intend to enforce,\" Melwani said. \"Now, our expectation is that that will continue to evolve.\"\n\nAlso during the quarter, Figma announced a [collaboration](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251106800815/en/ServiceNow-and-Figma-Launch-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Turn-Design-Vision-Into-Enterprise-Transformation) with [ServiceNow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NOW/) to convert designs into applications for large companies to adopt.\n\n\"We were pleased to see positive commentary around both Figma Make and Figma Design, indicating increased adoption of AI workflows across Figma's platform,\" RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria, with the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock, wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThere could be room for Figma to address new kinds of corporate workers, beyond developers, designers and marketers. Product managers, for instance, are increasingly involved on Figma files, Field said o\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: Stock Movers: Wingstop, Analog Devices, Bayer - Bloomberg\nLink: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2026-02-18/stock-movers-wingstop-analog-devices-bayer-podcast\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: Today&#x27;s biggest winners and losers in the stock market.

Several officials want to see clearer evidence of disinflation before additional cuts. CME FedWatch indicates 94% probability of unchanged rates at March meeting.\n\n---\n\n## 🛢️ Commodities\n\n| Commodity | Price | Change |\n|-----------|-------|--------|\n| WTI Crude Oil | $65.47 | +4.5% (Wednesday session) |\n| Gold | $4,983-4,985/oz | +1.8% (Wednesday session) |\n| Silver | $77.10/oz | +4.9% (Wednesday session) |\n| Natural Gas | Data unavailable | — |\n\n**Note:** Oil surge driven by renewed U.S.-Iran tensions despite ongoing diplomatic talks. Gold and silver rebounded as safe-haven demand returned.\n\n---\n\n## 💱 Currencies\n\n- **DXY (Dollar Index):** 97.70 (+0.6%)\n- **EUR/USD:** $1.1850 (down from $1.1852)\n- **USD/JPY:** 152.90 (down from 153.51)\n- **GBP/USD:** Data unavailable\n\n**Trend:** Dollar strengthened modestly after Fed minutes showed hawkish undertones.\n\n---\n\n## 📰 Key Headlines\n\n1. **Fed Minutes Reveal Deep Division** - Officials split on rate cut timing; some open to hikes if inflation proves sticky\n2. **Nvidia-Meta AI Partnership** - Multi-year deal for millions of AI chips boosts tech sentiment, Nvidia +1.6%\n3. **Strong U.S. Economic Data** - Industrial production (+0.7% vs. +0.4% forecast), housing starts, and durable goods orders all beat expectations\n4. **U.S.-Iran Nuclear Talks Progress** - Nations reached understanding on \"guiding principles\" but deal not imminent; keeps oil prices elevated\n5. **Walmart Earnings Today** - Retail giant reports before open; shares down 1.5% pre-market on consumer spending concerns\n\n---\n\n## 🏭 Sector Watch\n\n- **Top Performing:** Technology (+0.8% via Nasdaq), led by Nvidia, Meta, semiconductor stocks; Materials/Metals gained on gold/silver surge\n- **Worst Performing:** Cybersecurity under pressure (Palo Alto -6.8%); Software sector facing AI disruption concerns (down 22% YTD)\n- **Notable Movers:** \n  - Global Payments +16% on strong outlook\n  - Figma +15% after hours on AI monetization success\n  - Cadence Design Systems +7.6% on earnings beat\n  - Moderna +6.1% on FDA flu vaccine review\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Economic Calendar (Today - Thursday, Feb 19)\n\n| Time (ET) | Event | Consensus | Prior |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| 8:30 AM | Initial Jobless Claims | 225,000 | 227,000 |\n| 8:30 AM | December U.S. Trade Balance | TBD | TBD |\n| 8:30 AM | Philadelphia Fed Index (Feb) | TBD | TBD |\n| Various | Fed Speakers: Bostic, Bowman, Kashkari, Goolsbee | — | — |\n\n**Friday (Feb 20):** PCE Price Index - Fed's preferred inflation gauge (critical for rate outlook)\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook\n\n**Market Sentiment:** Cautiously optimistic as tech rebounds from recent AI valuation concerns. The Nvidia-Meta partnership provided much-needed validation for AI infrastructure spending, lifting semiconductor and tech-adjacent stocks.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n- **Fed Policy Uncertainty:** Minutes revealed stark divisions - some officials favor holding rates steady indefinitely, others want flexibility for cuts if inflation cooperates. This ambiguity keeps markets range-bound.\n- **AI Productivity Debate:** Split views on whether AI will suppress inflation (via productivity gains) or fuel it (via economic acceleration and spending).\n- **Economic Resilience:** December data surprised to the upside across manufacturing, housing, and capital goods - suggesting Q4 GDP may exceed 2.5% consensus. This strength argues against aggressive rate cuts.\n- **Geopolitical Watch:** U.S.-Iran talks progressing but fragile; any breakdown could spike oil further. Market positioning remains defensive.\n\n**What to Watch Today:**\n1. Walmart earnings - bellwether for consumer health\n2. Jobless claims - labor market stability crucial for Fed path\n3. Fed speaker commentary - any hints on March meeting stance\n4. Friday's PCE data setup - will drive short-term positioning\n\n**Technical Levels:** S&P 500 holding above 6,850 support, but still 1.5% below all-time high near 6,982. Resistance at 6,900-6,920 range. Treasury yields stabilizing after recent climb; 10-year at 4.10% key psychological level.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
