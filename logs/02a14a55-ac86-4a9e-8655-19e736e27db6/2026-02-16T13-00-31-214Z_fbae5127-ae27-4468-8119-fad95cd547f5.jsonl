While the New York Stock Exchange ([NYSE](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/nyse/today.aspx \"NYSE Today\")) and the Nasdaq are not holding regular trading sessions, global financial activity remains focused on the momentum generated during the previous week and the performance of U.S. equity futures.\n\nIn early holiday-thinned trading, U.S. stock futures showed modest gains as investors continued to digest a pivotal inflation report released last Friday. Futures for the [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) edged higher by 0.2%, while [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DIA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DIA)) futures also climbed 0.2%. These movements suggest a cautiously optimistic start to the week, building on the steadying action seen at the close of the prior session. On Friday, February 13, the major indexes finished with mixed results: the S&P 500 ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) rose slightly to 6,836.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) added 0.1% to reach 49,500.93, and the Nasdaq Composite ([IXIC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/IXIC)) slipped 0.2% to 22,546.67.\n\n## Economic Outlook and the Federal Reserve\n\nThe primary driver of current market sentiment is the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed that U.S. inflation cooled to 2.4% year-over-year in January. While this remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, it represents a significant improvement from the 2.7% rate recorded in December. This cooling trend has revitalized hopes for multiple interest rate cuts in 2026.\n\nMarket participants are closely monitoring signals from the Federal Reserve regarding the timing of these cuts. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was flat at 4.052% this morning, reflecting a period of stabilization after the volatility induced by earlier concerns over \"higher-for-longer\" rates. Analysts suggest that if upcoming economic data continues to show easing price pressures, the Fed may have the necessary \"confidence\" to begin a more aggressive easing cycle by mid-year.\n\n## Major Stock News and Corporate Developments\n\nDespite the holiday closure, several major public companies are making headlines following Friday's active session. Apple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)) remains a focal point after shares traded between $254.98 and $264.16. The tech giant recently announced a strategic partnership to integrate Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/GOOGL))'s Gemini AI models into its Siri voice assistant, a move seen as a critical step in its \"Apple Intelligence\" rollout. Alphabet itself recently hit a historic $3 trillion market capitalization, joining the elite ranks of Microsoft ([MSFT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MSFT)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)).\n\nNvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)), the bellwether for the artificial intelligence sector, saw its stock decline 2.2% on Friday as investors grappled with potential disruptions in the software industry caused by rapid AI advancements. Meanwhile, Tesla ([TSLA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/TSLA)) continues to see high volatility as the market weighs the company's shift toward autonomous driving software and next-generation vehicle production.\n\nIn other notable news, Coinbase ([COIN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/COIN)) surged 16.46% in the last full trading session, buoyed by a rally in the cryptocurrency markets. Applied Materials ([AMAT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMAT)) gained 8.08% following a strong earnings report that highlighted resilient demand for AI-related semiconductor equipment. Additionally, AppLovin ([APP](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/APP)) rose 6.4%, recovering from a sharp sell-off earlier in the week.\n\n## Global Market Performance and Upcoming Events\n\nWhile U.S. floors are quiet, international markets are active. In India, the Sensex jumped 650 points to close at 83,277.15, led by a late-day rally in banking stocks. European markets also trended upward, with the Stoxx Europe 600 climbing 0.3% in morning trading.

On April 2, which he called \"[Liberation Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%27s_Liberation_Day_speech \"Donald Trump's Liberation Day speech\")\", Trump announced sweeping tariffs impacting nearly all sectors of the [US economy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States \"Economy of the United States\") The announcement triggered widespread [panic selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_selling \"Panic selling\") across global stock markets.

Aber jetzt tritt dieser marktbreite US-Index scheinbar auf der Stelle. Und was das Thema Dynamik angeht, wird es dadurch langsam problematisch. Denn am damaligen Rekordhoch des Oktobers war der S&P 500 bis 6.920 Punkte gelaufen. Jetzt, fast drei Monate später, liegt der Index gerade einmal 20 Punkte höher. Das ist dünn.\n\nKann es sein, dass diese runde Marke für zu viele Marktteilnehmer ein Ziel ist, eine Marke, bei der man nicht nur darüber nachdenkt, Kasse zu machen, sondern es auch wirklich tut? Liegen da so viele Verkaufsorders im Markt, dass die Käufer nicht durchkommen? Und könnte das dazu führen, dass mehr und mehr bullische Trader aufgeben und der Index dadurch direkt unter dieser runden Marke abdreht und eine größere Korrektur startet? Sprich: Ist dieses bisherige Unvermögen, nach oben auszubrechen, ein aus Sicht der Bullen böses Omen?\n\n[Den aktuellen Kurs und Chart des S&P 500 sowie Kursinformationen und alle Aktien des Index finden Sie hier.](https://www.lynxbroker.de/boerse/boerse-kurse/index/sp-500/)\n\n**Expertenmeinung:** Nein, eher nicht. Es mag zwar sein, dass in diesem Bereich einiges an Verkaufsorders den Anstieg bremst. Aber ob die abgearbeitet werden können oder nicht, lässt sich noch nicht abschätzen. Das liegt auch daran, dass am Freitag eine Abrechnung an der Terminbörse stattfand. Hier liefen Optionen auf Aktien und Indizes mit Laufzeit Januar aus. Und anders als bei uns sind die Optionen in den USA das entscheidende Derivat der Privatanleger – und diese Abrechnung muss nicht, könnte aber als Bremse gewirkt haben.\n\nEs wäre beispielsweise möglich, dass Optionsverkäufer, die in der Regel zu den großen Adressen zählen, so viele 7.000er Call-Optionen auf den S&P 500 an die Trader verkauft haben, dass sie ein hohes Interesse hatten, diese Optionen nicht zur Abrechnung ins Geld laufen zu lassen, weil das hätte teuer zu stehen kommen können. Ob die 7.000 ein massiver, nicht zu hebender Deckel ist oder eine eher durchlässige Hürde, wird sich daher erst noch herausstellen, zumal es gar nicht unüblich ist, dass die großen US-Indizes eine Zeitlang unter oder an solchen markanten Chartmarken verharren, bevor klar wird, ob die Reise weitergeht oder, was seltener der Fall ist, eine solche „Big Figure“ nicht bezwungen wird und das dann eine Korrektur einläutet.\n\nRichtig ist natürlich, dass die Rahmenbedingungen problematisch sind. Viele US-Konjunkturdaten der vergangenen Tage waren recht gut, aber keineswegs alle. Die Politik im Weißen Haus wird zunehmend aggressiver und unberechenbarer, das wird auch für die Wirtschaft zum Risiko. Und die offene Gerichtsentscheidung über die Zölle sowie das Sägen an der Unabhäng\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771246855167}}

(AI image)\n\nPrecious metal prices are expected to remain volatile and witness further consolidation in the coming week as investors track key US economic indicators, including inflation data, GDP readings and signals from the Federal Reserve, analysts said.Traders are also likely to monitor US labour market data, the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and speeches from Fed officials for clarity on the timing and pace of potential rate cuts, as per news agency PTI.\n\nGold, Silver Under Pressure After Peaks: Should You Invest And Hold Precious Metals Or Sell Off?\n\n### Volatility to persist on US GDP, PCE data\n\nPranav Mer, vice president, EBG – commodity & currency research at JM Financial Services Ltd, said gold and silver prices may continue to witness consolidative moves, though volatility is expected to persist.“Gold and silver prices may continue to see more consolidative moves but volatility will prevail with focus on incoming US data on GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation numbers and Federal Reserve official's commentary,” he said, as per PTI.On the domestic front, silver futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) declined Rs 5,532, or 2.2 per cent, over the past week, while gold rose Rs 444, or 0.3 per cent.\n\n### Gold corrects sharply in February\n\nPrathamesh Mallya, DVP – research, non-agri commodities and currencies at Angel One, said gold prices have corrected in February.“Gold prices have fallen in February 2026, with prices correcting from highs of Rs 1,80,000 per 10 grams to around Rs 1,53,800 per 10 grams as on February 13,” he said, as per PTI.He attributed the weakness to stronger-than-expected US employment data, which has reduced expectations of near-term rate cuts and weighed on gold prices in the past week.“However, the yellow metal's safe haven appeal remains intact on account of geopolitical tensions, and strong buying ahead of the Lunar New Year. It's a tug of war between bears and bulls this week, and the volatility will continue in the week ahead,” Mallya added.\n\n### International trends and market drivers\n\nIn the international market, Comex gold futures gained $84, or 1.7 per cent, during the week, while silver edged up marginally to close at $77.27 per ounce.Mer said gold prices moved between gains and losses through most of the trading sessions but managed to end the week higher.“Gold prices see-sawed between gains and losses for most part of the trading session, but managed to close the week in positive and above $5,000 per ounce in the overseas market.“The bullions are passing through a phase of consolidation amid a lack of clarity among traders as they remain divided over the price direction and look for fresh fundamental triggers,” he said.Analysts noted that central bank buying, safe-haven demand amid a sharp sell-off in global technology and AI stocks, and a softer dollar index provided support to bullion prices.However, mixed physical demand from India and China, profit-booking by ETF investors and strong US macroeconomic data capped the upside.Mer said silver also experienced two-way price movements during the week.“The white metal was weighed by corrections in industrial metals and profit-booking after failing to breach key technical resistance. It also faced pressure from the tech-led global equity sell-off, which reduced risk appetite across asset classes,” he added.Analysts said both gold and silver are likely to remain range-bound in the near term as investors await clearer signals on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy trajectory and broader global economic trends.\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Map Shows States Where Incomes Are Rising Fastest—and Slowest - Newsweek\nLink: https://www.newsweek.com/states-incomes-rising-falling-map-11526380\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: <strong>Colorado, Georgia and Maine are the three states where incomes are rising the fastest</strong>, according to new data analysis, while North Carolina, Oklahoma and Hawaii are the states which have seen the slowest income growth.\nContent:\nColorado, Georgia and Maine are the three states where incomes are rising the fastest, according to new data analysis, while North Carolina, Oklahoma and Hawaii are the states which have seen the slowest income growth.\n\nAccording to a study by Visual Capitalist, which used data from the U.S. Census Bureau, median household income in Colorado increased by 46.9 percent from 2019 to 2024, the fastest income growth in the U.S.\n\nIn the same time period, they found that incomes in North Carolina and Oklahoma increased the slowest, by 9.9 percent.\n\nHousehold incomes, on average, rose 21.9 percent nationally during the period Visual Capitalist analyzed.\n\nBelow, _Newsweek_ has created a map showing states where incomes are rising the fastest and slowest.\n\n![](https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Map-Shows-States-Where-Incomes-Are-Rising-Fastest-And-Slowest.jpeg?w=1600&quality=80&webp=1)...\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThe economy, the cost of living and other related themes like incomes are important to American voters, with a Gallup poll showing that they overwhelmingly cited economic pressures as the main reason they voted for President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIncomes can determine where people choose to live and affect people's housing and other standard-of-living indicators.\n\nRising incomes can also bolster support for local and federal government while, in turn, stagnating economic conditions can foster discontent among voters, something that will be important when voters vote in the midterm elections in November.\n\n## What To Know\n\nThe analysis found that Colorado's average income increased from $72,500 to $106,500—an increase of 46.9 percent. The study attributed this to the state's \"thriving tech industry.\"\n\nGeorgia had the second-biggest increase in income growth, with the median household income increasing by 43.4 percent—from $56,630 to $81,210. The study said this was because of job creating in the electric vehicle and aerospace sectors.\n\nIn Maine, incomes increased by 36.3 percent and Montana came a close fourth, with an average increase of 36.1 percent.\n\nTennessee was the state with the fifth-fastest income growth, with a 34 percent change in median household income.\n\nNorth Carolina and Oklahoma, on the other hand, topped the list in terms of states with the slowest income growth. They both saw a 9.9 percent change in median household income, from $61,160 to $67,220 and $59,400 to $65,310, respectively.\n\nHawaii did not fare much better, and saw an 11.6 percent increase in median household income. There was a 12.6 percent income increase in the District of Columbia, and a 13.2 percent increase in Illinois.\n\nIt comes after recent analysis by [MyPerfectResume](https://www.myperfectresume.com/career-center/careers/basics/the-illusion-of-wage-growth) found that Americans are [making more money](https://www.newsweek.com/americans-earn-more-than-ever-yet-can-afford-less-11475405) than they did a few years ago, but rising prices have quietly erased most of those gains, leaving many with less real spending power than before the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent WalletHub analysis of TransUnion and Federal Reserve Bank data found that average household debt increased by $275 to $975 from the second to the third quarter of 2025.\n\n## What People Are Saying\n\n**The Visual Capitalist study said:** \"\"Where you live matters a lot. While some states tracked close to the national average, others saw incomes climb at nearly double the pace, driven by booming local industries and major investment.\"\n\n**Hannah Jones, a senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com said**: \"Rising incomes increase purchasing power, allowing buyers to qualify for larger mortgages, compete more aggressively, and absorb higher monthly payments. For sellers, stronger incomes can translate into firmer demand, fewer price cuts, and improved leverage in markets where inventory remains tight.\"\n\n## What Happens Next\n\nEconomists are predicting robust [economic growth](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/economic-growth) and [strong gain](https://www.newsweek.com/us-sees-new-shape-economy-emerging-11517916)s for U.S. equities in 2026 as in 2025, [but they have](https://www.newsweek.com/2026-to-see-weaker-job-growth-and-higher-inflation-warns-leading-economist-11308782) warned that less affluent consumers will continue to grapple with rising prices and a slowdown in the labor market.\n\n> > ![](https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Top.png?w=1600&quality=80&webp=1)\n> > \n> > In a polarized era, the center is dismissed as bland.

In currency markets, the dollar index was broadly steady with a slight upward bias.\nContent:\nUS [consumer prices](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/consumer-prices) rose less than expected in January, reinforcing expectations that [inflation](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/inflation) pressures remain contained, according to Reuters. This keeps the outlook intact for [interest rate cuts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/interest-rate-cuts) later this year.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index increased by 0.2% in January following a 0.3% rise in December. On a year-on-year basis, prices climbed 2.4%, slightly below economists’ expectations of a 2.5% increase. The release of the report was slightly delayed due to last week’s three-day shutdown of the federal government.\n\nFinancial markets reacted cautiously to the data. U.S. stock futures went slightly lower after the release, while U.S. Treasury yields declined, with the benchmark 10-year yield easing modestly, according to a news report. In currency markets, the dollar index was broadly steady with a slight upward bias.\n\nThe softer inflation reading supports the view that the [Federal Reserve](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/federal-reserve) may have room to ease [monetary policy](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/monetary-policy) later in the year, as reported by Reuters. While inflation remains above the central bank’s 2% target, the latest figures suggest price pressures are not re-accelerating.\n\nThe report's underlying details indicate that disinflation trends are continuing, though some components still show pockets of firmness. Cooling price pressures in areas such as shelter helped keep overall inflation in check, even as certain services categories recorded firmer increases.\n\nThe inflation data comes alongside mixed signals from the labor market, as recent employment figures point to resilience but also highlight uneven strength across sectors. Policymakers are likely to weigh both inflation and employment trends as they assess the appropriate timing for any policy adjustments.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will continue to monitor upcoming economic releases and Federal Reserve communications for further clarity on the path of interest rates. Markets remain sensitive to incoming data as participants gauge whether inflation will continue to trend lower, allowing policymakers to begin easing later this year, as stated by Reuters.\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: What Will Shape The Stock Market Today?

Dalal Street Might Have a Weak Opening._**\n\nThe Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, look set for a cautious Monday open – and if you’re a trader, this might be one of those _**“sip your coffee slowly”**_ mornings. Mixed global cues and jittery tech stocks are keeping sentiment on edge, while Gift Nifty trends hint at a soft start. In other words, the bulls may choose patience over bravado at the opening bell.\n\nFriday’s sharp sell-off still lingers in memory, especially in the IT space, where AI-led disruption fears continue to stir debate – is it opportunity knocking or risk creeping in? With key macro triggers lined up this week, clarity is scarce and volatility could stay elevated.\n\nYou Might Be Interested In\n\n_**So, what’s the game plan Today?**_ I would suggest you should stay nimble. Watch support levels closely. Look for stock-specific opportunities rather than broad-market heroics. If supports hold, selective buying may emerge. If not, brace for more swings. Either way, it’s a market that demands strategy – not impulse.\n\n### **_Stock Market On Friday_**\n\nOn Friday, the market ended sharply lower:\n\n* **Sensex** fell 1,048.16 points (1.25%) to 82,626.76\n* **Nifty 50** declined 336.10 points (1.30%) to 25,471.10\n\nHeavy selling in IT stocks amid AI disruption concerns weighed on sentiment.\n\n## _**What Is Shaping The Stock Market Today? Global Cues**_ \n\n### _Asian Markets_\n\nAsian markets traded flat amid thin volumes due to Lunar New Year holidays.\n\n* Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.2%\n* MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index gained 0.1%\n* China, South Korea, and Taiwan markets remained closed\n\n### _Wall Street Performance_\n\nUS markets ended mixed on Friday after softer-than-expected inflation data:\n\n* Dow Jones gained 0.10% to 49,500.93\n* S&P 500 rose 0.05% to 6,836.17\n* Nasdaq Composite fell 0.22% to 22,546.67\n\n_**Major tech stocks saw pressure:**_\n\n* Nvidia fell 2.23%\n* Apple declined 2.27%\n* Meta dropped 1.55%\n* Tesla rose 0.08%\n\n## **_Commodity & Currency Market Update_**\n\n### _Gold & Silver Prices_\n\n* Spot gold fell 0.3% to $5,026.96 per ounce\n* Silver dropped 1.1% to $76.54 per ounce\n\n### _Dollar & Bond Yields_\n\n* Dollar index slipped 0.03% to 96.90\n* US 10-year yield fell to 4.048%\n\n### _Crude Oil Prices_\n\n* Brent crude: $67.73 per barrel\n* WTI crude: $62.86 per barrel\n\n## **_Key Stock Market Event That Would Trigger_** \n\n### _US Inflation Data_\n\nUS consumer inflation showed signs of cooling in January, providing some relief to financial markets. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.2% during the month, falling short of economists’ expectations of a 0.3% rise. The softer-than-forecast reading reinforced optimism that price pressures may be gradually easing. The data strengthened investor belief that the US Federal Reserve could consider cutting interest rates later this year. As a result, US Treasury yields declined, reflecting improved market confidence in the inflation outlook.\n\n### _Japan GDP Growth_\n\nJapan’s economy recorded modest growth in the October–December quarter, expanding at an annualised rate of 0.2%, well below the 1.6% growth forecast by markets. On a quarterly basis, GDP rose 0.1%, missing the 0.4% estimate. The weaker-than-expected performance highlights challenges such as global uncertainties and sluggish domestic demand. Although the economy avoided contraction, the subdued growth suggests a fragile recovery, which could influence future monetary policy decisions by Japanese authorities.\n\n## **_Stock Market Outlook For Monday_**\n\n### _Sensex Prediction_\n\nSensex formed a reversal pattern near the 84,500 mark and closed the week with a bearish candle, indicating short-term weakness. Immediate support is placed at 82,500 (20-day SMA), followed by 82,200 and 81,700–81,500. On the upside, resistance is seen at 83,100 and 83,700–84,000 near the 50-day SMA zone.\n\n### _Nifty 50 Prediction_\n\nNifty 50 formed a large bearish candle and slipped below its 50-day DEMA, reflecting increasing downside pressure. Key supports are placed at 25,450, 25,300 (200-DMA), 25,200–25,250, and 25,000. Immediate resistance stands at 25,550–25,600, followed by 25,800.

In currency markets, the dollar index was broadly steady with a slight upward bias.\nContent:\nUS [consumer prices](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/consumer-prices) rose less than expected in January, reinforcing expectations that [inflation](https://m.economictimes.com/definition/inflation) pressures remain contained, according to Reuters. This keeps the outlook intact for [interest rate cuts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/interest-rate-cuts) later this year.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index increased by 0.2% in January following a 0.3% rise in December. On a year-on-year basis, prices climbed 2.4%, slightly below economists’ expectations of a 2.5% increase. The release of the report was slightly delayed due to last week’s three-day shutdown of the federal government.\n\nFinancial markets reacted cautiously to the data. U.S. stock futures went slightly lower after the release, while U.S. Treasury yields declined, with the benchmark 10-year yield easing modestly, according to a news report. In currency markets, the dollar index was broadly steady with a slight upward bias.\n\n \n\nThe softer inflation reading supports the view that the [Federal Reserve](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/federal-reserve) may have room to ease [monetary policy](https://m.economictimes.com/definition/monetary-policy) later in the year, as reported by Reuters. While inflation remains above the central bank’s 2% target, the latest figures suggest price pressures are not re-accelerating.\n\n \n\nThe report's underlying details indicate that disinflation trends are continuing, though some components still show pockets of firmness. Cooling price pressures in areas such as shelter helped keep overall inflation in check, even as certain services categories recorded firmer increases.\n\nThe inflation data comes alongside mixed signals from the labor market, as recent employment figures point to resilience but also highlight uneven strength across sectors. Policymakers are likely to weigh both inflation and employment trends as they assess the appropriate timing for any policy adjustments.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will continue to monitor upcoming economic releases and Federal Reserve communications for further clarity on the path of interest rates. Markets remain sensitive to incoming data as participants gauge whether inflation will continue to trend lower, allowing policymakers to begin easing later this year, as stated by Reuters.\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771246874985}}

and New York sessions.\nContent:\nMaximize your profits by understanding the optimal trading hours and market overlaps between the Asian, London, and New York sessions.\n\n## What is Trading Hours for CFD ?\n\nTrading hours for Contracts for Difference (CFD) refer to the specific times during which traders can buy and sell these financial instruments. CFDs allow traders to speculate on the price movement of various underlying assets, including cryptocurrencies, without owning the actual asset. The trading hours for CFDs can vary depending on the asset class and the broker offering the service. Typically, cryptocurrency CFDs are available for trading 24 hours a day, five days a week, reflecting the continuous nature of the cryptocurrency market. However, specific trading hours may be influenced by market events, regulatory changes, or the broker's policies. Understanding these hours is essential for traders to plan their strategies and execute trades effectively.\n\n## How does Trading Hours for CFD work?\n\nWhen discussing global trading sessions, it is essential to understand the significance of the Asian, London, and New York markets. Each of these sessions brings unique characteristics, liquidity levels, and trading opportunities that can greatly impact traders' strategies. Understanding these trading hours is crucial for maximizing potential profit, particularly when trading Contracts for Difference (CFDs) on platforms like BYDFI. The Asian trading session, which begins around 11 PM GMT and runs until 8 AM GMT, is often characterized by lower volatility compared to the other sessions. Currency pairs like USD/JPY and AUD/USD are particularly active during this time. Traders seeking to capitalize on the quieter market conditions may find this session ideal for entering positions with less risk of sudden price swings. For instance, if a trader anticipates a bullish movement in the AUD/USD pair based on economic data released during this session, they might decide to open a CFD position early in the Asian hours, potentially benefiting from a gradual price increase. As the Asian session concludes, the London session begins around 8 AM GMT and lasts until 5 PM GMT. This session is often regarded as the most significant trading period due to the high volume of transactions and the overlap with both the Asian and New York sessions. The London market is a hub for Forex trading, and it is during this time that many economic reports are released, which can lead to increased volatility. For instance, if the UK releases positive economic data, traders might see a surge in the GBP/USD pair, presenting a prime opportunity for CFD trading. The overlap between the Asian and London sessions, which typically occurs from 8 AM to 9 AM GMT, can be particularly lucrative. During this brief period, liquidity increases as both sessions are active. Traders can witness significant price movements in various currency pairs, making it an excellent time for executing trades. For example, a trader can analyze the performance of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin against USD during this overlap to identify short-term trends and make informed trading decisions. Following the London session, the New York trading session opens at 1 PM GMT and continues until 10 PM GMT. The New York market is pivotal, especially for trading cryptocurrencies, as it coincides with the closing of the London session. The overlap between these two markets occurs from 1 PM to 5 PM GMT, which is often a prime time for traders to engage in CFD trading. During this overlap, traders can take advantage of high liquidity and volatility, particularly in major currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY. Real-world use case scenarios illustrate the importance of timing in trading. For instance, a trader who analyzes market sentiment and notices a bullish trend in Bitcoin as the New York session begins might choose to open a CFD position. They could set a stop-loss order to manage risk while aiming for a profit target based on historical resistance levels encountered during this session. Additionally, understanding the best times to trade can significantly enhance a trader’s overall strategy. Traders who are active during market overlaps can capitalize on rapid price movements, while those who prefer less volatility might focus on sessions with lower trading volumes. To optimize trading strategies around these global sessions, traders should consider the following steps: 1. Monitor Economic Calendars: Keep an eye on economic announcements that could influence market conditions during each session. For example, U.S. employment reports released during the New York session can lead to significant price changes. 2. Identify Overlap Opportunities: Focus on the timeframes when sessions overlap, as this is often when the market is most active. The London/New York overlap from 1 PM to 5 PM GMT is particularly fruitful for CFD trading. 3. Set Clear Entry and Exit Strategies: Based on the market dynamics observed during each sess\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771246882608}}

There is no need to refresh your browser. This chart also gives you up to 20 years of historical data, so you can see the long-term gold price trends. Live and historic data is available in seven different currencies.\n\nYou can then use those real-time spot prices to place an order using BullionVault's live order board, selecting your gold market from Zurich, London, New York, Toronto or Singapore.\n\nOn BullionVault you can buy [gold](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/gold) in US Dollars, Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen.\n\n| | Gold Spot Price Today |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gold Price per Gram |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Kilo |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Ounce |   |   |   |\n|   |\n\n| Gold Price Last |\n| --- |\n| Current Price | |\n| High | |\n| Low | |\n| Change | |\n\nThis gold price chart is a live feed of the spot price in the wholesale market. It closes over the weekend and public holidays. BullionVault, on the other hand, never shuts. It allows you to trade gold 24 hours a day, every day of the year.\n\nSet a custom [gold price alert](https://www.bullionvault.com/price-alerts.do) on the website or app to be emailed or notified whenever the gold price moves through your chosen value.\n\nYes, BullionVault gives you direct access to wholesale gold, silver, platinum and palladium at live professional-market prices, starting from as little as 1 gram at a time.\n\nIt's important to understand that the spot price shown above on BullionVault's chart is provided for reference. Like the spot price published by other sources (such as Reuters or Bloomberg) it represents the average of many wholesale quotes, and – crucially – it represents the average of those quotes' mid-points.\n\nSpot, in other words, doesn't necessarily reflect a price you might actually get from any individual bank or dealer, and it cannot reflect the spread between prices to buy and prices to sell.\n\nFor private investors, only BullionVault gives you direct access to that trading spread, enabling you to set or accept prices as you choose using our live [Order Board](https://www.bullionvault.com/order-board.do).\n\nYou will benefit from the lowest costs for buying, selling and storing gold. You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day. Place your order for gold by 2:35pm to secure the daily price shown (11:40am for silver, 1:35pm for platinum and palladium).\n\nNo Daily Price is published on Saturday and Sunday, or on certain UK public holidays.\n\nYes. Ordering at the [Daily Price](https://www.bullionvault.com/daily-price.do) is an easy way to buy and sell gold. Tell us how much you want to trade and we'll do the rest for you.\n\nThe actual bullion and cash normally take two working days to settle to your account. For a purchase, your funds stay in your account and are reserved until the bullion is settled. Likewise for a sale, the bullion you are selling is reserved in your account until you receive the cash, typically after two working days.\n\nOpen orders are only executed on days when an appropriate gold price is published.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is published in troy ounces in US Dollars, Euros and British Pounds (1 troy oz = 0.0311034768 kg). On BullionVault, you place orders in kilograms. We convert the as-published price of gold per ounce to a price of gold per kg and round up to the nearest Dollar, Euro or Pound. We use the same gold price per kg for buying and for selling with no spread.\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day. Additionally, once you open a BullionVault account, you can opt-in to receive the [Weekly Market Update](https://www.bullionvault.com/info/weekly-update).

Moreover, a combination of supporting factors warrants some caution for aggressive bearish traders, and before positioning for deeper losses.\n\nA modest US Dollar (USD) uptick, along with a generally positive risk tone, exerts some downward pressure on the safe-haven bullion. However, geopolitical risks remain in play ahead of the second round of US-Iran nuclear talks [this week](https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar). In fact, the US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed. In response, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have warned that they could retaliate against any US military base in case of strikes on their territory. This, in turn, could act as a tailwind for the Gold price.\n\nMeanwhile, any meaningful USD appreciation still seems elusive amid dovish [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) (Fed) expectations, which tends to benefit the non-yielding yellow metal. As investors look past last Wednesday's blowout US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, softer US consumer inflation figures released on Friday lifted market bets that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in June. The headline US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2%, while the core gauge increased 0.3% last month, which backs the case for further policy easing by the Fed and could help limit the downside for the [Gold](https://www.fxstreet.com/brokers/best-brokers-to-trade-gold) price.\n\nFurthermore, relatively thin trading volumes on the back of the Presidents Day holiday in the US could further hold back traders from placing aggressive directional bets around the XAU/USD pair. That said, the Fed speak could provide some impetus to the USD and the commodity. The focus, however, will remain glued to the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, which will be looked upon for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. Apart from this, traders will take cues from the global flash PMIs on Friday to grab some meaningful opportunities during the latter part of the week.\n\n## XAU/USD 1-hour chart\n\n![Chart Analysis XAU/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fchart-analysis-1771214920147&w=1536&q=95)\n\n## Gold faces rejection near 100-hour SMA pivotal resistance\n\nThe XAU/USD pair's inability to find acceptance or build on Friday's move up beyond the 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) favors bearish traders. The commodity holds beneath this gauge, which slopes lower and sits near $5,028.40, capping rebounds and preserving a bearish intraday bias. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) slips below its signal line and into negative territory, with a widening negative histogram that reinforces downward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 45 (neutral), tilting lower and aligning with the soft tone.\n\nMomentum would remain pressured while the XAU/USD pair stays under the declining 100-period SMA, as sub-zero MACD readings and a negative histogram argue for seller control. A recovery attempt would gain traction only if the MACD line crosses back above its signal line and the RSI reclaims 50, as that combination would ease downside pressure and allow a corrective bounce to unfold.\n\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\n\n## Economic Indicator\n\n### FOMC Minutes\n\nFOMC stands for The Federal Open Market Committee that organizes 8 meetings in a year and reviews economic and financial conditions, determines the appropriate stance of monetary policy and assesses the risks to its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. FOMC Minutes are released by the Board of Governors of the [Federal Reserve](http://federalreserve.gov/) and are a clear guide to the future US interest rate policy. \n\n[Read more.](https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/event/e10a1f69-915d-44b1-ad1d-0b8edf7853f3 \"read more\")\n\n**Next release:** Wed Feb 18, 2026 19:00\n\n**Frequency:** Irregular\n\n**Consensus:** \\-\n\n**Previous:** \\-\n\n**Source:** [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm)\n\nMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is usually published three weeks after the day of the policy decision. Investors look for clues regarding the policy outlook in this publication alongside the vote split. A bullish tone is likely to provide a boost to the greenback while a dovish stance is seen as USD-negative. It needs to be noted that the market reaction to FOMC Minutes could be delayed as news outlets don’t have access to the publication before the release, unlike the FOMC’s Policy Statement.\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: 70 ounces of Gold Price Today in USD｜Gold Price Calculator\nLink: https://www.bitget.com/en-CA/stock/gold-price-calculator/70-ounce-in-usd\nAge: 2 days ago\nSnippet: The calculation updates in real time, allowing you to quickly estimate the value of gold without manual calculations.

Additionally, AppLovin (APP) rose 6.4%, recovering from a sharp sell-off earlier in the week. While U.S. floors are quiet, international markets ...\nContent:\n## Market Overview and Holiday Closure\n\nThe United States stock market is closed today, Monday, February 16, 2026, in observance of the Presidents' Day federal holiday. While the New York Stock Exchange ([NYSE](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/nyse/today.aspx \"NYSE Today\")) and the Nasdaq are not holding regular trading sessions, global financial activity remains focused on the momentum generated during the previous week and the performance of U.S. equity futures.\n\nIn early holiday-thinned trading, U.S. stock futures showed modest gains as investors continued to digest a pivotal inflation report released last Friday. Futures for the [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") ([SPY](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPY)) edged higher by 0.2%, while [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average ([DIA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DIA)) futures also climbed 0.2%. These movements suggest a cautiously optimistic start to the week, building on the steadying action seen at the close of the prior session. On Friday, February 13, the major indexes finished with mixed results: the S&P 500 ([SPX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SPX)) rose slightly to 6,836.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJI](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/DJI)) added 0.1% to reach 49,500.93, and the Nasdaq Composite ([IXIC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/IXIC)) slipped 0.2% to 22,546.67.\n\n## Economic Outlook and the Federal Reserve\n\nThe primary driver of current market sentiment is the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed that U.S. inflation cooled to 2.4% year-over-year in January. While this remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, it represents a significant improvement from the 2.7% rate recorded in December. This cooling trend has revitalized hopes for multiple interest rate cuts in 2026.\n\nMarket participants are closely monitoring signals from the Federal Reserve regarding the timing of these cuts. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was flat at 4.052% this morning, reflecting a period of stabilization after the volatility induced by earlier concerns over \"higher-for-longer\" rates. Analysts suggest that if upcoming economic data continues to show easing price pressures, the Fed may have the necessary \"confidence\" to begin a more aggressive easing cycle by mid-year.\n\n## Major Stock News and Corporate Developments\n\nDespite the holiday closure, several major public companies are making headlines following Friday's active session. Apple ([AAPL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AAPL)) remains a focal point after shares traded between $254.98 and $264.16. The tech giant recently announced a strategic partnership to integrate Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/GOOGL))'s Gemini AI models into its Siri voice assistant, a move seen as a critical step in its \"Apple Intelligence\" rollout. Alphabet itself recently hit a historic $3 trillion market capitalization, joining the elite ranks of Microsoft ([MSFT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MSFT)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)).\n\nNvidia ([NVDA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/NVDA)), the bellwether for the artificial intelligence sector, saw its stock decline 2.2% on Friday as investors grappled with potential disruptions in the software industry caused by rapid AI advancements. Meanwhile, Tesla ([TSLA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/TSLA)) continues to see high volatility as the market weighs the company's shift toward autonomous driving software and next-generation vehicle production.\n\nIn other notable news, Coinbase ([COIN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/COIN)) surged 16.46% in the last full trading session, buoyed by a rally in the cryptocurrency markets. Applied Materials ([AMAT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMAT)) gained 8.08% following a strong earnings report that highlighted resilient demand for AI-related semiconductor equipment. Additionally, AppLovin ([APP](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/APP)) rose 6.4%, recovering from a sharp sell-off earlier in the week.\n\n## Global Market Performance and Upcoming Events\n\nWhile U.S. floors are quiet, international markets are active. In India, the Sensex jumped 650 points to close at 83,277.15, led by a late-day rally in banking stocks. European markets also trended upward, with the Stoxx Europe 600 climbing 0.3% in morning trading. Conversely, Asian markets were mixed; Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.2% following disappointing GDP data, while markets in China remained closed for the Lunar New Year.\n\nLooking ahead, the earnings calendar for the remainder of the week is packed with high-profile releases. Investors are awaiting results from retail giants Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) and Home Depot ([HD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/HD)), as well as tech leaders Cisco Systems ([CSCO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CSC\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Real-Time Stock Market News - US Stocks Live Feed | Stock Titan\nLink: https://www.stocktitan.net/news/live.html\nAge: 41 minutes ago\nSnippet: Access critical information affecting stock prices and market trends.

benchmarks snapped ... While <strong>Sensex and Nifty gained strongly, select stocks including Ola Electric, Inox Wind and Firstcry tumbled on weak earnings, whereas Engineers India and EaseMyTrip surged</strong>....\nContent:\nFeb 16, 2026\n\n**Shivendra Kumar, ETMarkets.com**\n\n## Newsmakers of D-Street\n\nIndian equity benchmarks ended their recent decline on Monday, buoyed by strong buying in financial and energy stocks, alongside support from pharma and healthcare names. The Nifty halted its two-session losing streak to settle at 25,682.75, advancing 211.65 points or 0.83%, while the 30-share BSE Sensex snapped a three-day slide to close at 83,277.15, gaining 650.39 points or 0.79%.Here are 7 stocks that saw action today:\n\nImage Source: ETMarkets.com\n\n## Ola Electric\n\nShares of Ola Electric plunged 7% intraday, hitting the day's low of Rs 28.71 on the NSE before closing at Rs 28.80, down 6.7%. The electric two-wheeler maker posted a net loss of Rs 487 crore in Q3FY26 versus Rs 564 crore in Q3FY25. Revenue from operations dropped 55% YoY to Rs 470 crore, reflecting slower growth in EV penetration and lower volumes.\n\nImage Source: ETMarkets.com\n\n## Inox Wind\n\nShares of Inox Wind crashed 8% to a 52-week low of Rs 97.53 Monday after India's wind turbine manufacturer reported a dismal quarter prompting brokerages to cut price targets and growth forecasts. Its consolidated revenue of Rs 1,208 crore missed estimates by 34% while adjusted profit of Rs 117 crore came in 35% below forecasts. Nomura and Motilal Oswal were among brokerages that cut their price targets.\n\nImage Source: ETMarkets.com\n\n## Capital market stocks\n\nShares of BSE ended 7.5% lower at Rs 2,726.30 while those of Angel One and Groww declined by up to 5%. The stocks fell following RBI's sweeping overhaul of lending norms for capital market intermediaries. The move effective April 1 is set to reshape the trading landscape. The new guidelines mandate that bank guarantees require 50% collateral with 25% in cash while loans for margin trading facilities demand 50% cash margin. Analysts say the tightening will hit different market participants in vastly different ways.\n\nImage Source: ETMarkets.com\n\n## Firstcry\n\nShares of Brainbees Solutions tanked 12% to hit their fresh 52 week low of Rs 236.80 before closing the session at Rs 239.50, down 11% over Friday price. The shares fell following weak Q3 earnings where the company widened its losses to Rs 28 crore versus 8 crore in the year-ago period.\n\nImage Source: ETMarkets.com\n\n## Power Grid Corporation\n\nShares of Power Grid Corporation ended 4.74% higher at Rs 300.80 on the NSE amid positive market sentiments. The company also informed exchanges last week about its acquisition of Bellary Davanagere Power Transmission Limited - the project SPV to establish transmission system strengthening for integration of additional RE potential at Davanagere (0.25 GW) and Bellary (2.75 GW), on build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT).\n\nImage Source: ETMarkets.com\n\n## EaseMyTrip\n\nShares of Easy Trip Planners surged 20% to Rs 7.93 on the NSE after the company informed exchanges about its plans to raise capital up to Rs 500 crore as part of its ongoing strategy to scale key growth areas and reinforce its financial strength. The board has approved, in principle, a proposal to raise funds through the issuance of equity shares and/or other eligible securities.\n\nImage Source: ETMarkets.com\n\n## Engineers India\n\nShares of state-owned Engineers India (EIL) closed 14% higher at Rs 230.51 after the company reported an over 3-fold on-year jump in net profit at Rs 302 crore in Q3 driven by strong execution and higher revenues. Turnover rose 59% to Rs 1,194 crore as revenue from the turnkey business doubled. It was its second successive double-digit rally.\n\nImage Source: ETMarkets.com\n\nThanks For Reading!\n\n## Next: Gainers & Losers: TCS, SpiceJet & Bajaj Finance among 6 top movers on Friday\n\n[Read Next](https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gainers-amp-losers-tcs-spicejet-amp-bajaj-finance-among-6-top-movers-on-friday/slideshow/128305262.cms)\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771246899982}}

The S&P 500 continues to test the psychologically significant 7,000 level after three months of consolidation near October's record high of 6,920.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n- **Inflation Cooling:** January CPI at 2.4% YoY (down from 2.7%) provides confidence for Fed policy easing despite remaining above 2% target\n- **Rate Cut Expectations:** Markets pricing in multiple cuts in 2026 after softer inflation readings\n- **AI Sector Volatility:** Technology stocks experiencing heightened volatility as investors assess AI disruption risks vs opportunities\n- **Holiday-Thinned Trading:** Low volumes expected to persist through Presidents' Day with focus shifting to Wednesday's FOMC minutes\n\n**Watch For:** FOMC meeting minutes (Wednesday) will be critical for gauging Fed's rate-cut timeline. Friday's Q4 GDP and PCE inflation data could reset market expectations. Thin trading volumes may amplify price movements.\n\n**Technical Note:** S&P 500 consolidating just below 7,000 with 50-day moving average support. Failure to break higher after three months near this level could signal increased correction risk. Treasury yields stabilizing suggests bond market confidence in disinflation narrative.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
